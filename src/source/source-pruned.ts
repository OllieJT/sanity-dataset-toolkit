			'<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">October’s Berlin Content Marketing Dinner was held on October 18th at Restaurant Gugelhof. Our attendees included a mix of local marketing managers, from freelancers to those employed by technology startups.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The main topics of conversation were how to maintain positive mental health and wellness in startup environments, and finding the best marketing tools for your content setup. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Maintaining mental health and wellness</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">One problem that many attendees mentioned was the challenge of maintaining mental health and wellness in a fast-paced and demanding work environment. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Potential solutions discussed included:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Setting boundaries.</b> Don’t be tempted to answer work messages at the weekend. Turn off notifications for apps like Slack if you have them installed on your phone.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Lead by example.</b> The tone at the leadership table dictates what work culture is acceptable at each company. How can leaders help their teams here?  </span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Efficiency relies on mental health. </b>Without prioritizing our mental health, we can’t perform to the best of our abilities. Prioritize yourself and set boundaries that work for you.  </span></li>\r\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Marketing tools</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Finding the right tool to perform all your content needs can be difficult.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Most attendees at the dinner use Asana for both project management and executing content strategy. Others use Google Suite for writing and collaborating on written content. Airtable is used by some attendees, but as more of a glorified Excel replacement than as a project management tool.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Are you local to Berlin? If you’re interested in attending the next dinner, email Megan at Megan (at) mtcthecontentagency.com to reserve your place at the table. </span>',

font-size: 14pt;">Plastic pollution in the oceans is a well-documented problem, with the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Economic Forum</a> suggesting that by 2050 there may well be more plastic than fish in our oceans. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But how did that plastic get there in the first place? While some plastic might be dumped in the oceans like fishing nets and domestic waste from boats and ships, for the source of the majority of oceanic plastics we actually need to look inland. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/marine-plastics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The IUCN</a> estimates that 80% of oceanic plastic pollution comes from land-based sources, with urban and stormwater runoff being one of the major problems. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Stormwater and plastics</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">When it rains, stormwater runs down our streets, collecting plastic debris as it goes. This contaminated water often ends up in our rivers and is a major source of oceanic plastic pollution. It’s estimated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic waste</a> in the oceans originates from rivers. In North America, the seasonal input of plastic waste in rivers peaks between June and October. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once plastics enter the oceans, it never truly disappears. As large “macroplastic” items like bags, water bottles and straws break down and degrade into pieces smaller than 5 mm in size, they become known as “microplastics”. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">While efforts like <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ocean Cleanup</a> and <a href="https://www.oceanvoyagesinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ocean Voyage Institute</a> are making inroads into reducing the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans, the best way to reduce plastic pollution in our oceans is to head back to the source - which is often plastics within stormwater. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What can individual businesses do to reduce their impact? A two-pronged approach is the most effective way to reduce plastics in stormwater. First, focusing on ways to remove plastics that are already in our waterways, and secondly taking concrete actions to reduce and prevent new plastics from contaminating stormwater in the first place. The chosen approach will vary depending on each type of business but the good news is there is plenty of innovation in this sector. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Filtering and removing plastics already in stormwater </span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">With a huge amount of plastics already in our waterways, one strategy is for businesses to work towards filtering and removing this before freshwater continues on its journey to the ocean. </span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Removing microplastics from watersourses </span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Microplastics can enter stormwater from a wide variety of sources, including tires and road wear, laundering clothes, footwear, sewage sludge, granules from artificial turf surfaces, and when larger macroplastics break down. Microplastics have also been used in exfoliants like facial scrubs and toothpastes, although their use in these products is gradually being reduced.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Stormwater retention ponds, especially in industrial or commercial zones, contain microplastics. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719314226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Runoff from highways and urban areas</a> is thought to be one of the main pathways for microplastics entering waterways. Filtration using either <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323363067.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sand or biochar</a> is being investigated as a potential way to remove microplastics from water before it continues downstream.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Adjustments to stormwater management techniques can also help to slow the flow of stormwater towards the oceans and remove pollutants at the same time. Combining <a href="https://www.ccb.se/documents/Postkod2017/CCB%20-%20Guidance%20on%20concrete%20ways%20to%20reduce%20microplastics%20in%20stormwater%20and%20sewage.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">constructed wetlands placed after wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)</a> can be an effective way to remove microplastics. </span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Improving macroplastic filtration capabilities of stormwater drains</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Many stormwater drains have a metal grate that prevents large plastic items from traveling further downstream. But smaller items including plastic bottles, straws, and food packaging easily travel through these grates. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The use of end-of-pipe nets designed to capture macroplastics down to 5mm in size is becoming an increasingly popular solution. Companies like <a href="https://stormwatersystems.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storm Water Systems</a> design nets for large diameter stormwater drains that can then be emptied using a two-man crew or a truck mounted crane. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">First flush storms often carry a significant amount of plastic pollution and if this isn’t collected as near to the source as possible, it often ends up in our oceans. <a href="https://stormwatersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Bandalong_CaseStudy_Satilla.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case studies indicate</a> that there’s a strong link between increased rainwater levels and higher amounts of plastic trash moving downstream.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">End-of-pipe nets are designed with built-in overflows to prevent flooding and can cope with powerful stormwater incidents. Other solutions are also available, with floating booms collecting debris on lakes, and litter traps for smaller waterways. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Preventing new plastics from entering watercourses  </span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The next stage is implementing a circular economy to work towards the majority of plastics being recycled or reused. This will drastically decrease the amount of plastic ending up in stormwater, which then makes its way to the ocean.  </span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Reusable B2B packaging </span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">B2B single-use plastic pallet wraps are a common choice for the stabilization of products during transportation. This technique, while very effective, leads to an estimated production of 5-6 million tonnes of plastic pallet wrap being produced every year. Inevitably, a portion of this ends up being disposed of incorrectly. Currently, only 14% of plastic packaging is recycled, leaving the vast majority as a potential stormwater pollutant. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Many companies have already started investigating more sustainable B2B packaging like lid and strap systems to secure pallet loads. Another choice is to use reusable pallet wrappers, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.reusawraps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reusa-wraps</a> and <a href="http://www.envirowrapper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envirowrapper.</a> Companies like Coca-Cola, Aldi, and Budweiser have already transitioned to the use of these types of systems. </span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Compostable and biodegradable packaging </span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For consumer-facing packaging, switching to compostable and biodegradable options is a viable way to reduce a company’s environmental impact. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The company <a href="https://www.e6pr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E6PR</a> creates compostable six-pack beverage rings designed to replace the common plastic variety which can be incredibly harmful to wildlife. These are being trialed by a range of beverage companies worldwide including Corona, Guinness, and Drink Simple.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Companies are starting to rethink their approach to the use of plastics down to the smallest level. Compostable Price Look Up (PLU) stickers for apples are being rolled out by New Zealand producers to replace the plastic stickers used previously. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Tackling plastic pollution at the source  </span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">With consumers now becoming more and more aware of the impact of plastic pollution, companies can show their commitment to environmental issues in a concrete way by taking affirmative action to reduce the amount of plastics in stormwater.</span>\r\n\r\nContinue reading additional articles on sustainability.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li class="entry-title fusion-post-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/berlin-environmental-startups/"><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">15 Innovative Berlin Environmental Startups Tackling Climate Change</span></strong></a></li>\r\n \t<li data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px">\r\n<p class="entry-title fusion-post-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/cleantech-content-marketing-agency/"><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">How A B2B Content Agency Can Help Drive Growth For CleanTech Companies</span></strong></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

			'<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social media has become a great platform to reach customers but also to educate and inspire climate action. Used by climate change activists, environmentalists, and companies, environmental social media builds a vital awareness of climate issues. When it comes to brands, it helps followers understand how their product is a solution to the climate crisis. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Environmental social media hashtags: #FridayForFuture</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Using specific hashtags will ensure your brand or message reaches a broader audience. Environmental brands have even started campaigns bringing awareness to particular topics: #FridaysForFuture is one of them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The movement started in August 2018, when 15-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young activists protested in front of the Swedish parliament for three weeks. They were trying to raise awareness against the Swedish government’s lack of action against climate change, and the movement went viral through Twitter and Instagram. Today, #FridaysForFuture is present in 7,500 cities and has over 14 million members. Their worldwide celebration is on the 19th of March.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Of course, the scenario is different for brands: it\'s essential to know where your audience is. Clean tech B2B brands, for example, can leverage <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/best-social-media-platforms-for-b2b-marketing/">LinkedIn and Twitter</a> to engage with specific stakeholders in their audience or generally engage with people in their target market.</span>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MT_Blog-Posts_Resource-banner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3940" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MT_Blog-Posts_Resource-banner.png" alt="know where your audience is" width="886" height="331" /></a>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Remember to show up consistently and keep a conversational tone!</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to start your environmental social media strategy</span></strong></h2>\r\nThe posts covering the impacts of climate change are often on focused education, news, awareness, and warning against its negative consequences. <a href="https://coolerfuture.com" rel="nofollow">Cooler Future</a>, for example, <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/berlin-environmental-startups/">a Berlin green start-up</a> that created an investing platform for users willing to invest in companies tackling climate change, uses <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coolerfuture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to inform and connect with future users. Although their product hasn\'t been launched yet, they already have more than 5,000 followers.\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A few basic steps to kickstart your strategy:</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Define your audience and how you’ll speak to them.</b> And after that, keep it consistent.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Identify important topics.</b> These can be questions, challenges, needs, or recurring themes that your audience find interesting and relevant.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Publish constantly. </b>The content should be distributed on platforms where your ideal audience hangs out.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Developing your environmental social media content strategy</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Your social media content should aim to educate and enlighten (or entertain) your audience, and it should sell your product too. With this in mind, we recommend starting with three pillars of monthly content:</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Pillar #1: education</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Find a core education topic related to your product\'s value proposition. Continuing with CoolerFuture\'s example, that could be financial investment and climate change educational posts.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Pillar #2: entertainment</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Here, we have the opportunity to highlight internal company expertise, sourcing information internally to share with your audience. Thought-leadership posts and expert interviews are a few of the examples.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To source what type of information your environmental business should be sharing here, talk to your team regularly and focus on their background, interests, and expertise.  </span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Pillar #3: selling</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The content on this pillar is pretty self-explanatory: it should be focused on selling your product and its features and benefits. Think of content pieces like testimonials, case studies, partnerships and media announcements, and much more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.planetly.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planetly</a>, for instance, has just announced a new partnership with <a href="https://www.8returns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8returns</a> which aims to reduce the environmental impact of the returns process. The news was shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/planetly_8returns-collaborates-with-planetly-activity-6782267969918509056-96vX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</span>\r\n<h3><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">And an extra tip!</span></strong></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">We recommend starting with these three pillars with <i>one key topic per pillar</i>. Check out <a href="https://plana.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plan A</a>\'s example.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">First, they did a series of educational posts about carbon emissions’ scope 1, 2, and 3. Once that was thoroughly explained, they moved onto product posts, telling their audience how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFKcSltHsj3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plan A Carbon Manager</a> works.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once you’ve defined your strategy and executed it consistently, your environmental social media can scale up into more thought-leadership topics or core educational topics related to your product. But first establish the content engine by setting up processes and your content calendar. Start writing content.</span>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3_Resource-banner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3942" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3_Resource-banner.png" alt="Establish your content engine and calendar" width="886" height="331" /></a><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Topic ideas for educating your audience</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A simple and effective way to find content inspiration is to publish your educational content around yearly events or environmental-related holidays, using specific hashtags to draw your audience toward your business. If an event already has a significant interest and traffic, your posts will get more attention!</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Popular environmental events to write content around</span></h3>\r\n<h4><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">#World Wildlife Day: 3rd of March</span></h4>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A day to celebrate and raise awareness of the world\'s wild fauna and flora.

From Twitter and Instagram to Facebook and LinkedIn, each channel has their own unique capabilities and audiences. But which one is best for a B2B audience? In this article, we’ll detail the reasons why LinkedIn is the best channel to use for reaching your B2B audience.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why do B2B businesses need social media channels?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">B2B businesses need social media to build an audience, grow their brand, and generate leads. The pandemic has made digital interaction all the more vital for growth and business strategy. B2B businesses can leverage social media to generate leads and communicate with their audience through content and online discussions. Social media is one of many marketing channels to drive inbound traffic for your company. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is the social media platform, LinkedIn?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111663/what-is-linkedin-and-how-can-i-use-it-?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn is a social media platform</a> for business professionals with a massive audience in the B2B market. People looking for opportunities, be that new careers or growing their brand, congregate and connect on LinkedIn. This makes it an ideal channel for B2B businesses’ to build an audience, post regularly, and build targeted profile connections.  </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">10 Reasons to Make LinkedIn Your Top B2B Social Media Channel</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Here are ten reasons you should try LinkedIn as your B2B social media channel.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>It’s where B2B business professionals spend their time.</b> When choosing a social media platform, you want to be where your target audience is. Making this conscious effort to locate and network with your target audience will yield the best results and ROI. With so many professionals in one place, LinkedIn is truly geared towards forming B2B business relationships through content. </span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>It’s a great place to show your thought leadership. </b>According to Hootsuite, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-statistics-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“96% of content marketers use LinkedIn for organic social marketing”</a>. Creating and sharing content on LinkedIn gives you the chance to be a part of your audience’s conversation. The more you post about your industry’s topics and trends, the more opportunities you have to become a thought-leader as you attract, engage, and delight your audience through content.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>It drives traffic to your website and business.</b> Related to the previous two points, another benefit of using LinkedIn is sending people to your business’ website and brand. According to Hootsuite, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-statistics-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“companies with a complete, active LinkedIn page see 5x more pageviews</a>” than those that do not. Using links carefully in your posts is one way to show readers where your information is coming from and point out your site. In other words, displaying thought-leadership and your product or services through your content can generate organic views and conversions for your brand. </span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>LinkedIn’s data gives you a clear picture of your audience.</b> Because LinkedIn is a site dedicated to providing networking to businesses, it comes with built-in audience tools like Sales Navigator to create targeted contact lists for your B2B industry.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Create engaging content on LinkedIn. </b>Use emoticons and hashtags to draw in prospects and retain current viewers to your posts. Tagging your business’ name and the topic of the posts helps people easily locate your content in searches. Just like your website’s content, you want to make sure that your hashtags are consistent and specific to your post. Another helpful feature is the ability to join groups relevant to your industry.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>LinkedIn has a comprehensive ad program for lead generation. </b>Where simply generating content has its perks, paid advertising targeting a specific market is yet another one of the platform’s mighty tools. With LinkedIn’s built-in tools you can target specific sectors of your audience (<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic Ads</a>) or craft an ad using an inhouse creator (<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ppc-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Text Ads</a>) to attract new customers to your business.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>LinkedIn can fuel your own learning.</b> One of the ways you can continue to create original and useful content for your audience is by expanding your own horizons and staying up-to-date on your industry. Reading other businesses’ content and findings on LinkedIn helps you write not only relevant content but shows that you’re part of and care about the industry.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Your connections can spread your content.</b> From the people you work with to community members and influencers, LinkedIn makes it easy for your connections and followers to distribute your content. Like the branches of a tree or web, one of your connections sharing your content with their followers will increase your visibility.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>LinkedIn helps you build and maintain relationships.</b> This point directly corresponds with a B2B business’ need to not only market a human-centered message but directly engage with audience members. LinkedIn’s commenting setup and groups are helpful ways to develop relationships. </span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Learning about your individual audience members is one click away. </b>Another boon for social media platforms is being able to view the profiles of those that are in your circle. It’s literally as simple as one click on their profile. This gives you an idea of who your audience is, what groups and industries they’re involved with, what their experience is, and who they\'re connected with. It’s a great way to build connections and expand your network in the industry.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Time to try LinkedIn!</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Remember LinkedIn is a social media platform, a place tailored towards delivering human-centered content, quality engagement, and networking.

The cleantech companies many times have a specific <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-niche-b2b-industries/">niche audience</a>. So, you’ll need a B2B content marketing agency that knows the clean tech industry and also how to market in niche sectors to form a strategy that works and to write content that delivers results. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Here is a breakdown of content marketing tactics for the cleantech industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Remember to include a <i>wide-range</i> of authority content for your marketing channels. Popular content for cleantech includes social media posts, videos, webinars, podcasts, and blog articles. Diversifying your content types and content topics casts a larger, more sturdy net to ‘catch’ different kinds of people at different buying levels from within your target audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Create webinars to attract and educate your audience.</b> Webinars are a great way to educate an audience. They also act as an attractive content centerpiece for both new and returning customers. A study by Optimiser found that <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“video marketers get 66% more qualified leads per year”</a> and that videos increased brand awareness by 54%. When you create a webinar you’re showing and telling what you already know about your industry in a highly consumable and measurable way. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Build backlinks and write articles for industry publications.</b> Backlinks are good for SEO, and they enable you to have higher search rankings on SERP. They build your credibility with Google determining how quickly people can find your website through search. The more backlinks you have on a website, the higher the linked content will rank on search engines. Make it a goal to be active in your link building efforts! Though this might be only one small part of the marketing equation it’s very important.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Collaborate with other cleantech companies. </b>Another way to reach new audiences is by collaborating. Collaborate with other technology companies on white papers, webinars, educational videos, or run a partnership campaign. Collaborations with others in your industry helps you grow your audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Try LinkedIn and Twitter marketing.</b> Over the years, LinkedIn and Twitter have become powerhouses in sharing B2B content and building audiences. Especially on LinkedIn, industry-specific communities congregate to share content, connect, and talk. Both LinkedIn and Twitter have a slightly different audience but, when used in combination, can form a great backbone for your B2B social media strategy. Read our article on which <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/best-social-media-platforms-for-b2b-marketing/">social media channels are best for B2B.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Use email marketing to educate and nurture your audience.</b> Automated emails have made it easier than ever before to nurture your audience. A study by Thuiswinkel.org and Spotler found that <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview/#benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“64% </a>of e-marketeers say that email marketeering and marketing automation contributes to more sales”. This statistic also shows improvement in other important areas like customer experience (45.9%), targeting of messages (68.5%), quality of leads (37.7%), and more. With the right touch of personalization and proper cadence of email releases, email marketing can become an important facet of your lead generation strategy. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Create content assets like white papers, ebooks, or use case flyers.</b> Like webinars and blog posts, these content assets exist to educate and nurture your audience. Case flyers and case studies give your audience concrete evidence of how your product or service can benefit them. Making case studies more of a visual experience using graphics or videos is a great way to grab viewers’ attention and make a greater impact. Ebooks are an educational piece that can be turned into a PDF for lead generation purposes. White papers, ebooks, and case flyers show that your business cares about the education of its audience and wants them to be informed about what you know. Read more about <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/typical-content-assets-to-fill-the-top-of-the-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular content assets</a> and how they can fill the top of the marketing funnel.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Host a podcast.</b> Podcasting is an audio content format that allows you to capture the <i>whole</i> attention of your listener. It’s a great way to show thought-leadership and your specific expertise in the clean technology industry. Like webinars and other content assets, this form of content shows your expertise and knowledge.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why do you need a clean technology content writer?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A clean tech content writer brings not only their skills in writing but also their direct experience in the clean tech industry. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">While they might not be thought-leaders, they’re definitely knowledgeable in many of the ins and outs of cleantech. They also have experience in spinning an attractive and effective piece of writing. The B2B industry calls for a higher caliber of writing that often combines both the knowledge and the efforts of <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/subject-matter-experts-improve-your-b2b-content/">subject matter experts and expert content writers</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Below are specific reasons why hiring a clean tech content writer is a must for this industry. </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>This industry is fast-moving and constantly innovating.</b> A cleantech content writer will know what trends are being set and new information is out there, and represent this in their writing. They have one ‘ear to the ground’, so to speak, in the cleantech industry and move in sync with its trends.</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>An everyday B2B content writer doesn’t know the demands or lingo of the industry. </b>Knowing the verbiage of an industry is a huge draw and connector to the clean tech industry’s audience. A content writer knowledgeable in what terms to use in which places also makes their writing more cohesive and complete. Remember, a B2B audience can tell when a writer doesn’t have an in-depth knowledge of the industry they’re writing about!</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Improving content credibility with a cleantech content writer.</b> A cleantech content agency staffed with creditable B2B clean technology writers will help your content rank on Google and build more credibility with your customers. Because they understand what they’re writing about, cleantech content writers can point out new perspectives on topics and ask meaningful questions. All of this attracts customers within your industry and has a higher potential to rank on Google. Hint: The expertise in the writer’s bio also helps with search rankings!</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Remember, settling for less than the above points (or doing without) can tarnish your brand’s reputation.</b> Working with a freelancer or agency that isn’t knowledgeable about this industry or doesn’t practice what they preach can reflect poorly on your credibility and leads. From miswriting on industry trends or technical phrases, having content on your blog or social media sends a message to your audience that you may not be professional or knowledgeable enough.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A knowledgeable cleantech content writer can produce content that meets your goals faster and with greater quality! A more efficient and effective writer is a great asset to your team. Less time will be spent researching basic information, lending more time to writing quality and audience-attracting information.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Hire a content agency for your CleanTech company</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Now you know what the best content marketing tactics are and why you should hire a cleantech content agency.

font-size: 14pt;">Learn what the Google’s Core Web Vitals update is and its purpose.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Know what elements are included in the Core Web Vitals update.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Get tips on how to optimize your blog so that you’re more visible on Google.</span></li> </ul> <span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Algorithms are ever changing and the way content is written, produced, and circulated is changing too. Google will update their search algorithm in 2021 with a few key ways that will impact how content is searched for and found. The update is called <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Core Web Vitals”</a> and it includes three key factors that Google considers in their content rankings: site speed, the experience of site visitors, and mobile device compatibility. Core updates are always happening, so this one won’t be the last. In this article, we’ve included six ways to make your content more visible on Google despite the updates. </span> <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">What is the Google Core Web Vitals update?</span></strong></h2> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Core Web Vitals is the upcoming Google update that launches in 2021. Basically it will give websites new guidelines as to what content ranks where in search results based on a website’s speed, accessibility on mobile devices, and the experience of page visitors. Your site’s ability to adapt to follow those guidelines will in turn affect how well people are able to locate your brand in search results. The purpose behind this update is to encourage websites to make content more aligned to the needs of humans. In this way websites at the topmost rankings will be the ones not only most related to a search query, but also be high-quality content and have a great website design.</span> <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">What is the purpose of the Core Web Vitals update?</span></strong></h2> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Google’s ongoing mission is to rank websites that provide speed, optimization, and content credibility. Google developers incorporate into the algorithm what the human visitor is doing on your site and if their needs are being met. Thus, the purpose of Google’s Core Web Vitals is to measure how well your website and content best serve the needs of the website visitor. </span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>What is Google’s mission?</b> To help everyone find the information that they’re looking for. Also Google’s human-centered approach is to <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“deliver the most relevant and reliable information available”</a>. The Core Web Vitals update follows that mission by motivating content and website creators to improve the quality and human accessibility. </span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">According to Google, their search engine should:</span> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Deliver the most relevant and reliable information available</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Maximize access to information</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Present information in a useful way</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Protect your privacy</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Help creators succeed online</span></li> </ul> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Does this sound familiar? It should. We also encourage our clients to strive to be as human-centered as possible to create rapport and loyalty in their customers. </span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Read more about MTC’s approach to <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/human-centered-content/">human-centered marketing</a>, and learn how to implement it in your own business, on our blog.</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Basically, in 2021 website visitors want pages to load quickly, be accessible on their smartphone, deliver quality content that’s not interrupted by too many popups, and not be held back by off kilter button hitboxes or menu complexities. In the next section, we’ll break down each of the areas that Google is targeting with this update and what they mean.</span> <h2><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">What is included in the “Core Web Vitals” update?</span></strong></h2> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Now we’re getting into the nitty-gritty details of the update. Google ranks content that is high quality material, has a great layout, and supports humans locating information. Here are the elements that Google will consider in this update:<b></b></span> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Website speed. </b>How fast does your website and/or content load? Is there lag while you scroll down the page or past media such as videos or pictures? Does your website load quickly on a mobile device? These are just some of the questions you might ask yourself when preparing to optimize and audit your site for the update. The reason speed is part of this update is because Google knows that <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/#:~:text=New%20research%20by%20Google%20has,t%20load%20within%20three%20seconds." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">viewers will sometimes turn away</a> from a site, despite the ranking or credibility, when it fails to finish loading within a few seconds. This is especially true on mobile devices because, despite their leaps in processing, they still are less powerful than computers. Yet, mobile devices are many people’s choice when surfing the web, even in the B2B industry.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Page experience.</b> How is your site laid out? Is information, even older information, available to find in a straightforward way? Are the dropdown menus and buttons easy to use, or do they have misaligned hitboxes and touchy expansions? Google refers to this as “page experience” and it represents how well a user can navigate a page to find what they need or even just use the page. It can range from visibility issues like small text or complex drop down menus that don’t work well, or something as simple as a user being able to find the information they came to the site for. If you have downloadable content and blog posts can people easily get to it? Or is it tucked away in another page or a specific search? How often do pop ups occur on your site? Again, review your site on a mobile device because Google is paying special attention to how well sites behave on mobile. </span></li> </ul> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Again, all of these updates go back to making your content marketing and website human-centered. <b>Human-centered content marketing</b> will become more relevant both in your content strategy but also to rank well on Google search.</span> <h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Make your content visible on Google</span></strong></h2> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">How can you make your content more visible on Google while keeping the Core Web Vitals update in mind? As a whole, the update is mainly geared towards improving your visitors’ user-experience, which is a vital part of B2B marketing best practices. Some of the changes you may need to make, such as improving menus and site layout, may require you to reach out to a web developer to help you. </span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Review these six ways to make your website more visible.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Check the </b><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Core Web Vitals report</b></a><b> to see how your webpage(s) are ranking.</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">This could be the first step in your audit as it will give you an idea of how well your site performs in its present state and will rank after the update.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Avoid keyword stuffing.</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Now is the time to shed and avoid the bad practice of keyword stuffing. Both search engines and human visitors have grown to avoid pages that constantly use the same choice keywords every few sentences but fail to give relevant information. If you need to use a keyword, use it sparingly and in the correct context. Synonyms are a great way to appeal to your audience’s need for well written content while also keeping the quality and purpose of the content ranked highly.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Use analytics to see where your visitors are clicking.</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Heatmap tools, like <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotjar</a>, give visuals of your site to show where visitors are clicking. This can show you what menus, links, and downloadable content are working and which aren’t. This can give you an idea of where visitors are missing important information or calls to action due to layout issues or distraction.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Use analytics to see how long your visitors are staying on a page.</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Google Analytics can help you find out how long people stay on your pages. Called ‘sessions’, this time-on-page data will show which pages perhaps didn’t deliver what the visitor was looking for and which did. Bounce rate is another important data figure to analyze.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Check loading speed using both a computer (and a mobile device).</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">This can be as simple as accessing your own website on a different web browser or incognito page to see how quickly it loads. Check the speeds of both text pages and pages that have videos, gifs, pictures or other more taxing features. Also you want to make sure it’s loading well on a mobile device so use your tablet or cellphone to make sure it isn’t taking any longer than a few seconds to complete.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Check site compatibility on a mobile device.</b></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Again, more people are using mobile devices to get their information than ever before. Audit your site for optimization for mobile devices by creating a mobile-friendly version of your site. Whether choosing a website template or having one custom-made, your website should be built for mobile.</span> <h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Let’s get blogging!</span></strong></h2> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Now, more than ever before, is the time to create a content marketing strategy and get your content published online. Consistent, high-quality content is not only helpful to get noticed by humans and search engines alike, but it also builds trust and authenticity with your audience. Use these six ways to optimize and audit your content for 2021’s Google Core Web Vitals update. If there’s one thing 2020 taught us, it’s to be prepared for the future and fulfill people’s need for more meaningful experiences online. <strong>Sign up for the B2B Marketing Next monthly email to

font-size: 14pt;">Key examples of high-performing pillar pages</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Pillar pages should be part of your B2B content marketing strategy, and they’re a best practice for content structure and SEO optimization. They will help you rank higher on SERP and convert a well-defined audience. While they may seem innocuous at first glance, the purpose that a pillar page provides, both for a business and the customer, is worthwhile and essential. Pillar pages should relate to each stage of the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience journey</a>, and they can also boost your brand as a thought-leader and educational resource. In this article, we discuss what pillar pages are, the steps to create one, a page’s defining elements, and examples of high-performing pillar pages.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What are pillar pages?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A pillar page is a website page that covers a subject that is a core topic related to your product or service. A pillar page, sometimes called a cornerstone content piece, can host a large collection of links to various articles (or website pages) within your website structure that relate to the assigned overarching topic. Under the umbrella of your pillar post, you can then group multiple topics related to the core pillar topic into <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/topic-cluster-content/">topic clusters</a>. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">So, pillar pages can be used to organize and connect content from across your site. They’re called pillar pages because, like an actual pillar, they’re the main building block of your content strategy and the topic supports your internal content structure.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3845" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3_Resource-banner.png" alt="" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>What is the main purpose of a pillar page?</b> The purpose of a pillar page is to provide visitors with a thorough answer to a core topic. This content can be either an introduction or deeper insight for your readers, but its main goal is to become a valuable resource and reference for them. Pillar page content includes information about a topic but also includes comprehensive answers to a reader’s question. So, the goal is to have readers return to make use of the information and to hopefully link to your pillar page as a key resource.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>How does a pillar page fit into a content strategy?</b> Pillar pages are a key part of your content strategy because they structure your content both for your audience and for search engines. In a content strategy, a pillar page corresponds with the core topics associated with your brand’s services. An example of a pillar page on our agency’s blog is the article on “B2B Content Strategy” and the topic clusters that support the pillar page include smaller form blog posts like “Establishing a <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/buyer-persona/">Buyer Persona</a>”, “What is an <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">Audience Journey</a>?”, or “What is a Content Calendar”. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/">B2B content strategy</a> is a core service for our agency, and we’ve written a pillar post to show our knowledge on the topic and our expertise to help you with this project.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">Benefits of a pillar page</span></strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The core benefits of a pillar page are to increase reader engagement, build authority on a specific topic, interconnect your internal content structure, encourage longer page view sessions, and be a well-optimized content piece for SERP (search engine rankings). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>What are the benefits in terms of your SEO ranking success?</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Your pillar piece content is more likely to be placed in the top result positions on search engines. Because a pillar post follows industry best practices, and it fulfills many search engine requirements to rank content—for example, increased content engagement and comprehensive information about topics. A pillar page can connect to different parts of your website with backlinks, allowing readers to easily go deeper into topics. The higher you can rank on search, the easier it is for people to find and read your content.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to structure a pillar page</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You’ve chosen a topic and now ready to write the pillar page. What are your questions before getting started?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>How does a pillar page’s format work?</b> The pillar page format is meant to be comprehensive on a subject and act as an introduction to other articles. Your content structure should flow naturally from one topic to the next, giving occasional calls to action, and question-answer type content. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>What level of content comprehensiveness should a pillar page have?</b> Pillar pages in their very nature are detailed and comprehensive because they’re supposed to completely cover a specific topic. They act as a content foundation for readers to branch into other related topics and it acts as a core SEO content piece. This calls for some thorough investigation into every portion of your pillar page’s content from the SEO optimization, to the content structure, to its appearance, and to the call-to-actions. The content should encourage your reader to stay on the blog and interact with your brand by writing content that is worth their time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>How long should a pillar page be?</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Pillar pages tend to be on the longer side, between 1,800 and 2,500 words of written content. A word count is just a general number because you\'re goal is to aim to write comprehensive content. Remember that comprehensive and thorough content will encourage readers to stay on your page longer and allow for more backlinks.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Key components of a stellar pillar page</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">From the topic to the pillar page type and standard writing best practices, these are the key components to writing a high-performing pillar page:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Finding the right topic</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Choosing the pillar page type for your topic</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Writing an introduction</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Structuring with a table of contents</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Taking note of user experience and design</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Including your lead generation piece</span></li>\r\n \t<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Concluding your thoughts</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Find a topic. </b>Your topic should address your audience’s key problems and/or challenges. Optimizing for a specific keyword is mandatory, but avoid keyword-stuffing—a practice that Google is downgrading in search result rankings. When coming up with a topic for your pillar page, having in-depth knowledge about who your buyer personas are is vital. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Think about what you want them to learn or what will help them solve their challenge. However, keep in mind, your pillar page topic shouldn’t be shallow. Pick a topic that has the potential to easily be 2,000 words of content and that offers several sub-topics where you can go write additional content on specific subjects.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3846" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3_Resource-banner-1.png" alt="" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Pick a pillar page type.</b> There are a couple of different pillar pages to choose from based on the layout and the purpose that the page has. A <i>resource pillar page</i> is based on organized anchor links within the text linking to various content within your website\'s structure. A <i>10x pillar page</i> is subtly different from a resource pillar page in that it contains more prominent headers, longer sections of text, and calls to action and/or options to share the content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Include a table of contents.</b> A great practice for user experience, this feature makes it easier for people to access the different information points in your post. And it gives the reader an idea of the page’s content. Put your table of contents/chapter section near the top of the page, under the introduction, for people to quickly locate it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Write an introduction. </b>An introduction is the first paragraph beneath the title. An introduction will tell the reader what to expect in the post. It signals the start of the article and promises what will be covered in that article.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Optimize for user experience.</b> At its core, pillar pages are about providing readers with a satisfactory answer and comprehensive knowledge. But user experience is just as important! Helping your readers better navigate your page is a best practice because it allows the readers to find the information they need faster and easily. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Using hyperlinks, also called anchored links, that link back to your topic cluster blog posts (or product website pages) is a great way to give readers the option to efficiently transition to other content. Lastly, a back-to-top button can help readers quickly return to the top of the page. Because pillar pages can be lengthy, having these navigation options can help readers save time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Provide anchor links (or hyperlinks) to other content.</b> This is where having a backlog and audit of articles related to your pillar page’s main topic is handy. Considered <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/topic-cluster-content/">topic clusters</a>, these topics give readers the option to continue learning by taking them to your linked page or post. These topic clusters are great for your internal website structure as it brings multiple topics and content together. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s also a best practice that search engines recommend, and they have the opportunity to power up your SERP ranking. Provide links within the pillar page’s text when you quote from another article. You can also use the phrase “Read more about x here.” with a link to that specific topic.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Having these anchor links not only sends traffic to other articles on your site but helps build trust and authority. It shows your experience and knowledge on these topics and how you can bring them all together in an organized fashion.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Remember not to oversaturate your post with links.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Downloadable content.</b> Having a downloadable content piece available on your pillar page is key for lead generation. Since a pillar post is a high traffic page, it can help you drive conversations to a downloadable content asset or newsletter. This downloadable content can be something related to the pillar page’s topic, such as an app or e-book, or even a PDF download of the pillar page itself. Downloadable content can be located either at the end of the content or at a related area within the page’s text.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Write a conclusion.</b> This section of the page is where you wrap up and summarize what the reader just read. Conclusions signal the end of the article to the reader and include a call-to-action or feature the downloadable content. A call to action could include, “sign up for our newsletter” “check out this other blog post for more information” or even offer a place for the reader to learn more about your product or service. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Keep in mind that your last call-to-action should be representative of where the content topic is in the customer journey. Try not to pitch a case study too early or pitch a generic white paper when it should be a use case flyer. Get the point? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Again, this should be a gentle call, not a shout with flashing lights. A gentler call considers the reader’s stage in the audience journey and even if they’re a returning customer. This very human-centered approach to optimizing your content with the right call-to-actions.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Awesome pillar page examples</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Looking for pillar page examples? Here are two examples of well-written pillar pages; one for B2B content marketing and the other for an environmental company.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/">“Introduction to B2B Content Marketing Strategy”</a> this pillar page describes what B2B content marketing is to forming a business strategy. It ticks the comprehensive requirement by describing what content marketing strategies are and then moving into why crafting such a strategy is a necessary step in being successful. It answers the reader’s questions, moving through the basics, such as the definition, to the more complex such as the steps to take to create a marketing strategy. Throughout, backlinks are provided to interconnect other content posts on the website and to provide additional knowledge in a subtopic.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.futureproofed.com/city-climate-action-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“City Climate Action Plan: A Structured Guide for Climate Planning”</a> delves into the topic of how a city can organize and create a city climate action plan. Again, the pillar page starts with a broad overview by defining what a climate change action plan is, then narrows the field down with more specific questions the reader might have. Especially prevalent are the outlined steps for creating such a climate plan, where the content backlinks to other subtopics on the blog.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What We Learned</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Now that you’ve learned what a pillar page is and the different steps and elements to create one. Pillar pages are an integral part of a business’ content structure. We hope that this introduction showed you the purpose behind creating a pillar page and gave you the insights to create one of your own.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container][fusion_builder_container type="flex" hundred_percent="no" hundred_percent_height="no"

B2B leaders want to be educated, which means that the content must be original, thorough, and relevant to them. The B2B industry also calls for high-quality content that is more technical. <strong>Through our agency experience, we’ve found that hiring content writers in clean energy or environmental technology with subject matter expertise delivers the best results.</strong> In this article, we discuss how expert-level content writers can work in tandem with subject-matter experts to create B2B content. And we cover the basis of what these two content roles offer.\r\n</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Subject matter experts definition: What is a subject matter expert? What is a content writer?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A <b>subject matter expert (or SME)</b> is someone who understands an industry and/or product very well. They’re usually CEOs, founders, or basically someone with authority in a business or industry topic. A subject matter expert is often someone with specialized knowledge. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">An example of a subject matter expert might be someone from the photovoltaic installation industry. This subject matter expert could have the title of CEO, Product Manager, or Head of Development. They have in-depth knowledge about photovoltaic paneling, installation, and a holistic picture of renewable energy. Also they would be a great resource as an industry subject-matter expert.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A content writer is someone who is skilled at writing, and will typically have at least a degree in writing such as technical writing or journalism. They use this skill to create content such as blog and social media posts. A writer can research a topic to gain a basic understanding of the topic for a project. A content writer is a valuable component of content creation because they have the vocabulary and experience to craft content that connects with an audience and conveys your ideas clearly.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">What is the difference between a subject matter expert and a content writer?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">A subject matter expert knows the ins and outs of their industry and/or product. They see the big picture and know the trends of their field, often making them a thought-leader. However, when it comes to putting their knowledge into words they can miss the opportunity to capture their audience’s attention because of their lack of formal experience or education in writing. Also, they might not have the time or energy to write as much content as necessary for their business simply because their job position requires them to do other tasks.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">A content writer, on the other hand, has been trained and has experience in writing in many different styles. A writer will know what words to use to achieve the purpose and direction of the piece of content. However, all the research a writer can do won’t make up for the subject matter expert’s knowledge of the industry. They don’t have the education or experience to be a true thought-leader in that particular industry subject which can make it difficult to speak to an experienced B2B audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Because of this, a subject matter expert and content writer can collaborate successfully and rely on each other to make content that connects with and educates their audience.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3804" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3s_Resource-banner.png" alt="Subject Matter Experts Vs. Content Writers: How They Improve Your B2B Content" width="886" height="331" />\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><strong>When do you use a subject matter expert and a content writer? Do you need one or both?</strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s beneficial to use a subject matter expert when you’re working on content that is highly technical, or you’re creating content for bottom-of-the-funnel pain points. Expertise is needed in these instances.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A subject matter expert is a great resource when content needs that touch of authority to describe special industry lingo or ‘behind the scenes’ information. Often, because they’re the founders, or other integral parts of the industry, they have real, hands-on knowledge that’s applicable to content production. Especially when your industry is <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-niche-b2b-industries/">niche</a>, and your audience knowledgeable of verbiage, having a subject matter expert as part of the writing process is great to give authority to the content. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A content writer is often in the marketing team, or can be an outside consultant, and works beside the subject matter expert to craft a writing piece. You may need to add a content writer to your team if you recognize that you (1) either don’t have the time to write content, or (2) you aren’t the best writer yourself, and/or are not sure how to proceed with going beyond industry facts to connect with your audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In many instances, having a professional content writer onboard will help make a business’ writing succinct and from a perspective a bit further from the industry or product. In this way, having a content writer with a supportive subject-matter expert to collaborate with will make your content stand out.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What are examples of subject matter experts and content writers?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Here’s an <a href="https://www.clickz.com/get-human-in-your-marketing-now-to-reach-b2b-buyers-in-2021/262994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example of how MTC founder, Megan Thudium, is a subject matter expert, and how she uses her subject-matter knowledge to write a content piece on the changes affecting the B2B industry from the COVID-19 pandemic.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A subject-matter expert might be a CEO or founder of a company who, because they’re a thought-leader, see a need within the industry for a new idea. Because they’re knowledgeable about what’s happening in their industry, they can begin to conceptualize an idea that hasn’t been considered yet, or target specific customer pains with their product. This could be a solution to a problem or even predicting the next big trend in the industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A content writer puts the information they learn from the subject-matter expert, their research, and their writing skills together to craft an idea into a more digestible article. They add different vocabulary, phrases, and lingo based on their audience. All while maintaining the voice and expertise of the subject matter expert. A content writer can be someone coming from a background in journalism, technical writing, or really any writing field. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/trends-environmental-energy-2021/">Check out this article written by our MTC content writer with an expert-level background in the renewable energy sector.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Best practice is to have a writer that has both subject-matter expert knowledge and the ability to write a compelling piece. However, we understand that these individuals are hard to locate in niche B2B industries.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Using subject matter experts’ background knowledge in the industry helps improve SEO, ranks content, and increases credibility and reliability. Here at MTC |The Content Agency, we strive to make content creation easy and meaningful with our combination of subject matter experts and B2B content writers. </span>\r\n<blockquote><em><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Our promise: “[...] to make content human. We create content to empower forward-thought and to create enlightening experiences—one client and strategy at a time.” It’s a key piece of our philosophy to provide our clients with <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content/">content</a> that is highly-relevant to the industry and with thought-leadership expertise.</span></em></blockquote>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">Let’s get writing!</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Now you know the difference between the roles of a subject-matter expert and a content writer, and what each role can offer. These two occupations can make a great marketing team and can create highly-valuable B2B content that nurtures, captures, and converts a B2B audience. When choosing an agency partner, make sure to ask about the agency’s writers. Are they experts in their craft? Do they understand your B2B industry? Do they have expert-level background knowledge in your industry? These are important questions to help ensure your project’s success!</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

With its innovation focus and skilled workers, environmental startups are able to flourish in the German capital — and it\'s easy to find amazing businesses tackling climate change with creative and accessible solutions. From wood bank cards to sustainable Christmas trees and easy investment in green energy, here are a few of the environmental Berlin startups that have caught our eye recently.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">Sustainable apps for a greener life: PeerPlanet, PlanA.Earth, Klima, and Planetly</span></strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Already in its beta phase, <a href="https://peerplanet.org/"><b>PeerPlanet</b></a> is an app that counts on supporting behavioral change to enable people to live more sustainably. This green Berlin startup bets on teamwork to implement the ideal surroundings to change our lifestyle — tracking our daily consumption of CO2 and understanding its influence. Together, we can definitely make a difference.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Businesses can also count on an app to reduce their carbon footprint. <a href="https://plana.earth/"><b>Plan A</b></a>, for example, has developed a software that helps companies calculate, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint through tailored sustainability action plans and offsetting. Their algorithm uses over 300,000 data points to predict and prioritize environmental issues in each country and connect companies to the most impactful environmental projects. <a href="https://www.planetly.org/en/"><b>Planetly</b></a> is also committed to helping companies achieve carbon neutrality using data - since businesses are one of the largest offsetters of CO2 globally, it\'s extremely relevant to have diverse projects working on it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If you have ever calculated your CO2 footprint and was disappointed about it, check out <a href="https://klima.com/"><b>Klima</b></a>. This environmental Berlin startup will allow its consumers to completely offset their carbon footprint by funding science-backed projects that remove or prevent the same emissions elsewhere. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Green Christmas is here! </span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The Christmas tree dilemma: get a natural tree (Berlin alone uses 400,000 Christmas Trees each year) that you can put in the compost bin or get a recycled plastic one that you will keep forever? <a href="https://wundertree.co/"><b>Wundertree</b></a> has made it easier for us: Christmas trees alive and in a pot delivered in Berlin and Potsdam. After the holidays are done, they’ll collect them and replant them in a forest. And if you want this project to come to your city as well, <a href="https://wundertree64795.activehosted.com/f/5"><b>sign up here</b></a>.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Greentech Alliance: an environmental startup for networking</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">How about joining a community of green startups around the world -- for free? <a href="https://www.greentech.earth/"><b>The Greentech Alliance</b></a> is a community of worldwide sustainability-focused companies that connects its members to tier VCs, media, and experts. The idea is to create new business opportunities for its members while sharing knowledge and awareness of best practices around green business, impact, and funding. </span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Investing in climate action: Cooler Future</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Become an investor and fight climate change at the same time — that\'s <a href="https://coolerfuture.com/en"><b>Cooler Future</b></a>\'s proposal. Still in development, this environmental startup promises to teach people about investment whilst giving them the opportunity to invest in the good guys: companies aggressively reducing their carbon emissions or working on removing carbon from the atmosphere altogether. We’re definitely looking forward to that!</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">No time? These green startups are planting trees for you: Ecosia, Active Giving, and TreeCard™</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You might not have the time to go outside and plant trees, but several environmental Berlin startups are doing this for you. How? Fitness app <a href="https://www.activegiving.de/"><b>Active Giving</b></a> converts your calories (or kilometers) into trees planted, for example, while <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/"><b>Ecosia</b></a> is a search engine that plants trees with its ad revenue. The search engine also powers <a href="https://www.treecard.org/"><b>TreeCard™ </b></a>a wooden debit card that uses card payments\' fees to sponsor tree planting around the world. If you ever needed an excuse to spend money, here it is!</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Mitte: fresher, cleaner water</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Our tap water is not as clean as we would like to think: it might contain traces of hormones, heavy metals, microplastics, fluorides, and much more. <a href="https://mitte.co/"><b>Mitte Labs</b></a> is in the process of developing home filters that use advanced filtration and remineralization technology to purify out water — mimicking the natural process that occurs when water is filtered through rocks.

No complications: <a href="https://www.zolar.de/"><b>Zolar</b></a>, for example, helps homeowners to produce their own green electricity and at the same time make an active contribution to climate protection by making the process of buying solar panels completely fuss-free.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://ecoligo.com/"><b>Ecoligo</b></a> has a similar proposal, helping businesses finance their move toward solar-powered energy. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.solytic.com/en/"><b>Solytic</b></a>\'s mission is to change the management of solar plants with interconnected value chains. The cleantech startup, founded in 2017, uses AI to identify potential and connects solar plants directly to offers from service providers. Then, users receive suggestions to improve the efficiency of PV-plants for more than 35 services, including direct marketing, financing, and many more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And these are only a few of the environmental Berlin startups that are bringing innovation and sustainability into our lives.

font-size: 14pt;">Did you know that <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of marketers</a> say that content marketing is very important to their overall marketing strategy? With small audiences, reaching your niche B2B audience can be daunting and downright difficult without the right approach. To be successful, you will need to understand the obstacles of reaching your niche audience before you can grasp the solutions. Then craft a strategy to go the distance. In this article, we discuss what these obstacles are, how to find a B2B niche audience, and how to implement the solutions to connect with them.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Common challenges in reaching a niche B2B audience</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">As a B2B business, you know how much effort and time it takes to get your content to the niche audience you’re writing for. Did you know that about <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-fifth of content marketers</a> feel that their content is achieving their goals well? With complex or highly specialized products, a niche B2B company has even more trouble reaching an audience. In this section, we’ll point out the different challenges that you may face so that you can understand how those challenges can impact your marketing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Getting your content in front of your audience </b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">This may seem the most basic and natural objective of a B2B business but when writing for a niche audience this task can become much more difficult. Because niche audiences have a smaller audience to target, the sheer number of people searching for your information through search engines can be surprisingly low: just 50 to 100 people per monthly search on a keyword. This means that you will need to find out where this small group of people hangs out online and how to reach them there. Do they use Reddit or LinkedIn? Are there groups or communities in either of those social media platforms based around this niche topic? Or do they congregate on an institution’s proprietary site?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Low search traffic for specific niche keywords</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Related to the previous point, if you’re writing about amorphous ideas and about niche topics, your search traffic may be low. However, in the case of niche B2B, you’ll want to focus more on the target audience finding your content and business rather than just the numbers. The search volume numbers are just a tool in the toolbox. How can you use long-tail words, phrases, or questions to narrow in on your niche audience?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Education authorities and research companies holding link authority</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">This obstacle is a bit harder to handle because it has less to do with the content you’re making and more to do with what your competitors are creating. Many niche B2B content businesses are already being regarded as a go-to thought leader in their area. Educational institutions and research firms also provide original thought-leadership on multiple niche topics. Thus, the already small audience is constantly driven to these higher-authority pages when searching for answers. This makes it difficult for the ‘new kid in town’ or smaller businesses to compete with an institution’s established authority.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For further reading on the topic, check out these related articles:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/how-much-b2b-content/">How Much B2B Content Should I Create for My Content Marketing Strategy?</a></span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/solar-companies-content-marketing/">How Solar Companies Can Leverage Content Marketing</a></span></li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/trends-environmental-energy-2021/"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Trends in Environmental Energy to Watch Out For in 2021</span></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/how-to-use-content-marketing-in-niche-b2b-industries/proxyclick-visitor-management-system-bgt-zkc6wa4-unsplash/" rel="attachment wp-att-3716"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3716" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/proxyclick-visitor-management-system-BgT-ZKC6WA4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Man sitting at a desk researching on his computer" width="1000" height="666" /></a>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Two approaches to find niche audiences\r\n</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The solutions to these challenges can be broken down into two categories: an SEO approach and thought-leadership strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>SEO approach</strong></span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Use broader keyword terms, in addition to the narrower ones, for your SEO</b>. This helps funnel variances in keyword searches to your content, casting a “bigger net” so to speak. It’s less about just “using everything” but instead of putting yourself in your audience’s shoes and thinking “What kind of words describe what my niche content is about? What are those words variants or synonyms?”. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><i>Example</i>: “B2B marketing” versus the more specific “What tools do I use to reach a B2B audience?”. Another: “B2B green technology” versus a topic that locates a specific niche “B2B environmental water management systems for German cities”. Where the more narrow, long-tail keywords is a great strategy, you may find low search traffic for them. It’s a balance between both broader and long-tail keyword terms.</span></blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Use a question-and-answer format to align with SEO phrases.</b> Many people type in questions like “How do I reach my B2B audience?” into Google search to find answers. Using a question and answer format helps your content appear higher search results when the wording corresponds with the questions an audience member is typing. A recent poll showed that <a href="https://www.elisedopson.co.uk/blog/b2b-content-marketing-statistics/">35% of content marketers</a> use keyword analysis for coming up with content. This means that having a thoughtful SEO phrase related to your content can give you the edge over your competitors. Again, the trick is to think creatively about what different kinds of questions and answers someone might use to find your content. Check out our headings on this <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/what-is-b2b-marketing/">article</a>. See how we ask questions to help audience members locate the answers to their queries?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><i>Example</i>: “What is B2B marketing?”, “How do I succeed in marketing to a B2B audience?’</span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><strong>Thought-leadership strategy</strong></span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Develop content that can be posted to a niche industry’s publication. </b>This ties back to figuring out where your audience frequents and connecting with them there. An example of such a publication is the <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com">Renewable Energy World</a>, existing in the renewable energy field. If you were a B2B business working within the niche category of renewable energy, this could be a place to reach your audience by posting thought-leadership content on their website. Check out our agency’s marketing approach for renewable energy businesses <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-clean-energy/">here</a>.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Engage in forums, chat rooms, and industry syndicated news publications to get your niche audience’s attention.</b> Some examples of these online help and discussion communities are Quora and Reddit. A recent statistic revealed that <a href="https://www.elisedopson.co.uk/blog/b2b-content-marketing-statistics/">35% of content marketers</a> found online communities to be their best source for promoting content. By being a part of the community on those community discussions, you begin to be seen as helpful and trustworthy—both important parts of leveraging empathy and becoming a thought-leader. Promoting your business’ content on these sites also helps gather an audience and build leads.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Use LinkedIn Marketing to create a list of contacts from your niche community that fit your audience criteria.</b> Did you know that “LinkedIn is the second-most popular social media platform used by <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics">B2B</a> marketers”? This makes it a valuable resource to learn about and grow your audience. Direct-Message, or DM, your contacts to start conversations and find out what their needs are. This is much more of an outbound marketing approach but it helps, in this case, when you are having trouble being noticed by your niche audience. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/linkedin/">Learn about MTC’s LinkedIn marketing program.</a><b></b></span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Partner with educational institutions and forums to do webinars or other authority content.</b> When longstanding institutions remain the main attraction and propagator for your niche audience’s information, work to get your content published or even acknowledged by those institutions. This can put your content directly on the institution’s site through videos, like a webinar, or a podcast. Creating content for these institutions helps you gain authority and recognition as a thought-leader in this niche, as well as reach your audience that trusts and utilizes those institutions’ sites. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Now you have a basic idea of how to seek out and market to your niche B2B audience. Marketing to a B2B niche industry is tricky, and it takes a few different strategic tools than traditional B2B marketing approaches. Try meeting your audience where they are online, engaging through LinkedIn, and partnering with industry publications to get started.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id="3704|large" max_width="" sticky_max_width="" style_type="" blur="" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align_medium="none" align_small="none" align="none" margin_top="" margin_right="" margin_bottom="" margin_left="" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" lightbox_image_id="" alt="" link="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/b2b-marketing-next/" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" sticky_display="normal,sticky" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" filter_hue="0" filter_saturation="100" filter_brightness="100" filter_contrast="100" filter_invert="0" filter_sepia="0" filter_opacity="100" filter_blur="0" filter_hue_hover="0" filter_saturation_hover="100" filter_brightness_hover="100" filter_contrast_hover="100" filter_invert_hover="0" filter_sepia_hover="0" filter_opacity_hover="100" filter_blur_hover="0"]https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29_Email-banner-1024x341.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Where B2B is marketing and selling products or services to only other businesses, B2C is selling only to customers not affiliated with any businesses. In other words, instead of a business or organization being the customer, the individual is the customer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Some examples of successful B2C businesses are:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Spotify</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Facebook</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Apple</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Microsoft </span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Google</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">However, sometimes these companies, such as Microsoft, will serve both B2B and B2C markets.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>What are the core differences between B2B and B2C content marketing?</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The core differences between B2B content marketing and B2C content marketing lies in the needs of the audience one is addressing and how to market to them specifically. Here’s a breakdown of these differences:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Audience:</b> A B2B audience is generally businesses therefore a B2B company’s website will display content that shows expertise and higher return on investment, or ROI, to the customer. Since a B2C audience is generally an individual customer, its marketing will try to be more appealing to a customer searching for a deal or making an emotional purchase.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Content &amp; Structure:</b> B2B content is focused on enticing businesses to educate themselves on a specific topic and develop trust that translates into sales. Meaning, they’ll want to have B2B content that feels catered towards their specific educational needs. Having content that reflects those needs puts your business in the position to solve customer challenges and build a relationship. When structuring B2C content, customers prefer less industry jargon and formality than a B2B site. It’s less about the ROI and more on the transformational process that the product provides. B2C customers will also prefer a ‘fun factor’ and will gravitate towards marketing experiences that provide entertainment. On the other hand, B2B can be content that is informative and educational.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Buying Cycle:</b> In the B2B industry the sale, or buying cycle, is longer than a B2C sale. B2B selling cycles are long and complex because there are multiple stakeholders, and the business’ need to come to a collective decision amongst its members. In B2C, the buying cycle mainly relies on a single customer’s decision. Yes, depending on the product’s price, multiple stakeholders can be involved in the buying decision. However, this is generally less complex than in B2B. Lastly, B2B customers are usually dedicated to a company for a longtime, as opposed to a B2C buying cycle that can be sporadic or event based.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3703" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bethany-legg-75nbwHfDsnY-unsplash.jpg" alt="What Is B2B Marketing: Common Questions Answered" width="1000" height="666" />\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>How does content marketing fit into B2B?</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/what-is-b2b-content-marketing/">Content marketing</a> is the act of sharing online content such as blogs, social media posts, and/or videos to build an audience and generate interest in a product or service. In B2B content marketing, this circulation of media takes on additional meaning as it builds a relationship with an audience in addition to generating leads. It’s mainly due to the B2B industry having long buying cycles and multiple decision makers. For already engaged customers, this creates a sense of authority and trust. For incoming customers, content marketing can show that a B2B site is engaged with the community, knowledgeable in their field, and dedicated to educating customers. In a B2B environment, content marketing is used to capture the attention of new leads but also to continue engaging existing leads.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>How to Start a B2B Marketing Campaign</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To start a B2B marketing campaign, you will need to take several steps. Each campaign has its own expectations, goals, desired outcomes, and tactical plan. It’s important to think clearly and thoroughly about what the desired outcome is to be, in order to create a strategy that produces results.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Understand your audience.</b> The first thing you’ll want to do is discover and define who your target audience is. Consider the following criteria: </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Age</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Experience/Education</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Gender</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Motivations</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Challenges</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Location</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Company Size</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Department Size</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Position Title </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Define your campaign goals and expected outcomes.</b> It’s very important to understand the goals and expected outcomes of a project. It will enable your B2B marketing campaign to be successful, and for you to choose the necessary tactical steps to reach those goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Define the marketing channels to reach your campaign goals.</b> A few channels would be:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">SEO Content </span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Thought-Leadership Content</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content Downloads</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Paid Advertising</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Email Marketing </span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Media Campaigns</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social Media Marketing</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In your B2B marketing campaign, you can choose a mix of Inbound and Outbound Marketing approaches. Both of these approaches have a place in your marketing strategy; however at MTC | The Content Agency, we work with Inbound Marketing. Inbound Marketing is a popular approach for a B2B marketing campaign. Overall, the goal is to <b>attract</b> website traffic, customer interest, and leads to your company brand. The opposite approach would be Outbound Marketing, which is a more traditional direct marketing approach that goes directly to the customer to convert them. For example, cold outbound emails are still a popular marketing tactic for outbound marketing. Inbound Marketing is very popular because it’s more affordable over time and yields a higher customer conversion rate.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: optima;">Now that you have a broader understanding of B2B marketing, you can be more successful in building an audience and developing an audience for your B2B business. At its core, B2B marketing is always about attracting a defined audience that has the intent to buy your product or service.  </span>  </span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id="3704|large" max_width="" sticky_max_width="" style_type="" blur="" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align_medium="none" align_small="none" align="left" margin_top="" margin_right="" margin_bottom="" margin_left="" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" lightbox_image_id="" alt="" link="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/b2b-marketing-next/" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" sticky_display="normal,sticky" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" filter_hue="0" filter_saturation="100" filter_brightness="100" filter_contrast="100" filter_invert="0" filter_sepia="0" filter_opacity="100" filter_blur="0" filter_hue_hover="0" filter_saturation_hover="100" filter_brightness_hover="100" filter_contrast_hover="100" filter_invert_hover="0" filter_sepia_hover="0" filter_opacity_hover="100" filter_blur_hover="0"]https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29_Email-banner-1024x341.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

As the founder of MTC | The Content Agency, I wanted to develop a conversational podcast where B2B marketing leaders could connect to discuss the constant shifts and changes in content marketing. As a marketing leader, I\'m often talking to B2B marketers weekly. They always have fantastic insight, and the podcast is a method to bring that knowledge to you, the listener.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Marketing in 2020 isn\'t like the marketing of the early 2000s. B2B audiences crave authenticity and authoritative content. Empathy marketing is a common term circulating the internet, and empathy plays a huge part in being a successful B2B marketer in today\'s world. Content is needed to connect empathetically to audiences. In this podcast, you will hear a mix of solo episodes and guest interviews with marketers where we deep-dive into relevant topics related to B2B content marketing.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Subscribe at your favorite podcasting channel.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="single solid" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" sticky_display="normal,sticky" class="" id="" flex_grow="0" top_margin="10" bottom_margin="10" width="" alignment="center" border_size="" sep_color="" icon="" icon_size="" icon_color="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" /][fusion_text columns="" column_min_width="" column_spacing="" rule_style="default" rule_size="" rule_color="" content_alignment_medium="" content_alignment_small="" content_alignment="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" sticky_display="normal,sticky" class="" id="" font_size="" fusion_font_family_text_font="" fusion_font_variant_text_font="" line_height="" letter_spacing="" text_color="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/b2b_marketer_launches_b2b_content_corner_podcast_to_help_b2b_companies_make_a_larger_impact_with_content_marketing_in_2021/prweb17376015.htm"><strong>Press release published originally on PRWeb.</strong></a></span>\r\n<h1 class="entry-title fusion-post-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">“B2B Content Corner” Podcast Helps B2B Companies Make A Larger Impact with Content Marketing in 2021</span></strong></h1>\r\n<p class="responsiveNews"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">MTC | The Content Agency, a B2B content agency for software and environmental technology companies, today announced the launch of the B2B Content Corner podcast (<a href="https://bit.ly/2DzsbDJ" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/2DzsbDJ</a>), a podcast covering B2B content marketing topics.

And as it’s B2B, we will tackle specific subjects that are a major concern to this industry while also tapping into both local and global marketer expertise in this ecosystem,” comments Megan Thudium, host of the B2B Content Corner podcast.</span></p>\r\n<p class="responsiveNews"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">B2B industries are impacted by the digital boom. To remain competitive, B2B companies will need to adapt content marketing best practices that are more customer-relevant and educational. The B2B Content Corner will introduce listeners to B2B content strategy topics, industry best practices, proven content frameworks, and developing case studies that will bring B2B companies closer to their audience, grow their financial bottom line, and develop more relevant leads.</span></p>\r\n<p class="responsiveNews"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Listeners can also look forward to hearing short audio snippets from B2B content marketers in the field, and their relevant insight and experience. Ultimately, this podcast is to help B2B marketing managers and entrepreneurs learn the needed actionable strategies &amp; tips to make their content thrive.</span></p>\r\n<p class="responsiveNews"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">With new episodes airing bi-weekly, the B2B Content Corner podcast launches today with two episodes: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="releaseul">\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In the first episode, we’re introduced to the upcoming podcast topics.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In the second episode, content strategist, Megan Thudium, deep-dives into LinkedIn marketing and how to leverage it in your B2B digital marketing strategy.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class="responsiveNews"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The podcast is set up as 20-minute episodes to connect with you during coffee hour.

Overnight, you had to shift perspective, strategies, and business goals before moving forward. Like any sudden economical shift, those that adapt quickly and apply industry best practices will pull through the tough times. And those that lag in adoption, they will lag even further behind. One essential point has surfaced from COVID-19. Where before the conversation was only dabbled upon, it’s now clear that your marketing approach must be customer-focused and companies must become ‘more human’ in their marketing approach. A post-COVID-19 era will demand for empathetic marketing.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><strong>COVID-19 changed B2B buyer’s mentality overnight</strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The B2B marketing mentality has been outdated. In complex industries, B2B marketing has taken the traditional marketing approach by supporting direct sales, collaborating on trade shows, and pushing out print media.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Where a few marketers might have incorporated digital marketing into their marketing mix, traditionally, marketers in the B2B across multiple industries relied on traditional methods to acquire customers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">COVID-19 was a shock to the traditional system. It brought on a forced digital transformation. Overnight, the best methods for acquiring new customers disappeared.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Tradeshow events went dark, and sales teams couldn’t schedule in-person meetings. Customer meetings and acquisition tactics went online. And this sudden swift was brutal for traditional B2B industries that had to adapt quickly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And if the B2B buyer’s mentality wasn’t already complicated, the buyers in this field today are even more cautious in their purchases. The B2B sales process will now require further nurturing, convincing, and buyer cycles have become even longer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You should be prepared to adapt your buyer’s journey accordingly to make sure that you’re accounting for more (and new) digital touchpoints.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>This article was originally published on <a href="https://www.clickz.com/get-human-in-your-marketing-now-to-reach-b2b-buyers-in-2021/262994/">ClickZ</a>.

It builds audience authority, grows inbound traffic, and helps you build a well-defined audience. B2B content marketing is an important puzzle piece to your lead generation, and it’s time to craft a strategy that meets your business goals. In this comprehensive article, the topic of B2B content will be covered: what is it? Why does it matter? Best practices.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is B2B content marketing</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/what-is-b2b-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a> is a collection of strategy frameworks, content assets, and content best practices, with the ultimate goal, to attract a specific and well-defined audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And you attract that audience through various content formats, strategies, and tactics. These include tactics include, but aren\'t limited to;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">SEO blog content,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Long-form editorial content,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content assets like white papers,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social media content, and</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">External website content placements.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once you attract a specific and well-defined audience, you can convert that audience into buying customers. Email is one of the most common conversion methods.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Benefits of B2B content marketing</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The benefits of B2B content marketing are that it builds authority, improves Google rankings, and helps attract a well-defined audience. Through consistent and quality content, a B2B company can build trust and authority with their audience. By the means of educational (and relevant) content, that audience will become familiar with your company, your knowledge, and will consider you a viable partner for their project.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3498" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/333_Resource-banner-1024x383.png" alt="What is B2B content marketing? Definition, channels, and best practices" width="1024" height="383" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Google search remains to be one of the top traffic drivers to your website. And because of this, being friendly with Google is good content marketing. Google algorithms are always changing. So, stay consistent with the latest in Google updates.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"> It’s important to understand what ranks (&amp; doesn’t rank) on Google, how to create quality content for Google (&amp; your audience), and how to leverage keywords to structure your content. Authority building with Google is one of the top benefits of B2B content marketing. And for you to reach this point, you need to be familiar with their quality content formula: EAT (expertise, authority, and trustworthiness)—and how Google judges the EAT principles for your specific niche.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Lastly, B2B content marketing drives leads. By using content methods to attract a well-defined audience to your website and social channels. You can engage that audience, capture their contact information, and start a conversation. If you create your B2B content marketing strategy to create a well-defined audience, lead generation will follow naturally.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to create a B2B content marketing strategy </span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s not a simple process to create a <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B content marketing strategy</a>. It requires strategy, experience, and using industry best practices. To start your B2B content marketing strategy, you will want to include the following pieces;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Defining the buyer persona</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Mapping the audience journey</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Determining the content topics</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Establish content formats and asset pieces</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Defining the key social media channels</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Outlining a distribution strategy</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The strategy includes everything except for content writing and the execution. It should clearly define your audience, their behaviors—and your tactical plan includes the action points and the content calendar. After its creation, you should understand who you’re writing for, the content types you’ll use, and how best to get that content in front of your defined audience.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What are the best content types for B2B</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The best content types for B2B are white papers, editorial content, SEO blog content, webinars, and email content. However, the best content types for YOU will change depending on your audience, team’s capacity, and objectives.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">There are a plethora of B2B content types. And you can spend hours determining the best for your audience (&amp; then creating that content). As a B2B consultant, my expert advice is to pick the top three approaches that are best for your audience, and then to consistently execute on them. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If webinars bring you leads, great! </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If SEO content is best, go for it. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Learn the best practices from others—but in the end, you need to choose the best content types for your company.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to develop B2B content ideas</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To develop B2B content ideas, you need to understand your audience, keep in touch with your audience, and know where to find their conversations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Creating B2B content ideas isn’t easy. It takes patience and research. As a strategist, I always recommend talking to your customer. That should be your primary method of developing B2B content ideas. In-person is best, but you can also talk to your customers in Facebook groups, LinkedIn posts, or industry-specific forums. Also, Quora is a great resource to see the specific questions that people are asking in your industry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Next, leverage your company’s team. The sales and leadership team is in-check with the latest industry trends, and they’re already talking to your customers. They’re a fantastic resource for B2B content ideas. Best practice would be to schedule a monthly meeting with these individuals to ‘content dump’ ideas.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to distribute your B2B content</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">B2B content marketing is 80% distribution and 20% content creation. You should be spending the majority of your time juicing the most out of the content you create. As best practice, plan to distribute new content up to six times within the two months of it being published. After those two months, drop to distributing the content once a quarter. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The best methods to distribute B2B content organically are;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Emails and e-newsletters</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social media channels (i.e. LinkedIn)</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Company employees</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Forums and chat communities (i.e. Facebook communities)</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">External distribution websites</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The best methods to distribute B2B content paid are;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Search engine marketing</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social media advertising</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Display advertising</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Native advertising</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Influence (or UGC) advertising</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As a general rule in our agency, we recommend that you only resort to paid advertising once you see traction organically. Observe your numbers and see what your audience is enjoying.

That is why you will find many companies asking for your name and email address in exchange for a checklist or an ebook. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And then sometimes you will find companies that provide a direct link to a piece of content and don’t require that contact information. This is the core difference between gated and ungated content.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>What is gated content?</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Gated content is a valuable content piece that is provided to you, as the website visitor, in exchange for key contact information. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The type of <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/what-is-gated-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information</a> that can be asked for includes a name, email, address, company name, phone number, details on their project, position title, and any other type of information specific to qualifying a lead. And these details are taken by a website form that can be provided by a marketing &amp; CRM platform.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once the visitor exchanges their information for the content asset, they’ll have direct access to the content through a landing page or the content asset will be sent by email.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>Should you gate every piece of content?</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I often hear this question asked by clients, and it’s a very good one. Marketers will argue this question for hours, but typically, we agree collectively that if the content asset is providing a significant amount of value (or it’s at an important level of your audience journey), then it makes total sense to gate that piece of content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But I believe that we should think <i>very</i> carefully about what to make gated and ungated in our content strategy. And I believe that decision is based around the customer experience that you want to provide to your website visitors.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3467" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3_Resource-banner.png" alt="Gated vs ungated content: how to use it for lead generation" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content is an experience for our audience. We have to remember this when we’re in the process of creating, publishing, and distributing content. Content tells our audience who we are, what we value, how we can help them—and it over time builds trust and authenticity through consistent content messaging.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>When to use gated content (and when not to use it)</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Gated content is valuable for many types of marketing goals. The most common goal is lead generation, and the marketing team has it on their agenda to collect information &amp; to generate leads for the sales team to follow up on. This is most commonly where gated content is useful. It provides the team with key information to build a customer’s story (and to decide if the customer is a marketing qualified lead (MQL)).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">However, if your main goal is brand awareness, relationship building, or authority building. It might be a better strategy to leave pieces of content ungated. This is mainly because these types of pieces are first touch instances or the start of growing a relationship.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Just like it would be weird to ask for a phone number at a networking event, gating too much information at the beginning of a relationship might be offset with the customer.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And that brings you to also consider the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience journey</a> level of the gated content piece. It’s in your best interest to use gated content at specific levels of the audience journey. Most commonly, a marketer will gate content that is in one of these phases.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Awareness level:</b> At this point, the customer knows of their challenge but they don’t know about a possible solution. Content like infographics, blog posts, ebooks, and podcasts are great content assets to build awareness on specific challenges.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><b>Consideration level:</b> At this point, the customer understands their challenge thoroughly, and they’re now actively looking for a solution. Usually, they’re looking for more detailed specifics on how to solve x/y/z—and they’re looking for partners to help them solve the challenge. Content like use cases, case studies, testimonials, storytelling, webinars, and demo sessions are valuable at this level.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">Both levels are important. But think about it: Would you want to discourage a long term relationship by issuing a gated content piece too soon?</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>How to decide if you should gate your content</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But brand awareness isn’t the only time that a company should choose <i>not</i> to gate a valuable content piece. You also have to ask yourself if the content piece is truly valuable.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Imagine if you were offered a promise that a certain content piece would solve your challenge. Once downloaded, it’s a thin piece of content without much value. You’d most likely be upset, a bit angry, and not very excited to keep engaging with that company.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Is your content piece valuable enough to gate?</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s an important question to ask because often enough the content piece isn’t valuable enough. Consider these few questions when you’re deciding if (or if not) to gate a piece of content.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Could the customer easily find this gated content topic as a blog post on your competitor’s website?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Is this gated content asset a quality topic that would jumpstart your sales funnel and lead to possible sales conversations?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Does this content asset introduce a core topic that is related to your product (or service)?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Consider these few questions carefully when deciding the difference between gated and ungated content. And remember everything doesn’t have to be gated on your website. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">At MTC, we decided not to gate our <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/contenthub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buyer persona template</a> because this is valuable information (but also widely provided on the internet). It’s not a very competitive gated content piece, and it doesn\'t offer much more value than what other templates currently are providing on the internet.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Think carefully when deciding what to gate and not to gate for your lead generation strategy. Keep customer experience in mind—and don’t gate information that can easily (&amp; freely) be obtained from a competitor.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Your audience is spending up to two hours a day engaging with content on the platform, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264116/weekly-linkedin-usage-of-registered-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistica</a>. And the number of LinkedIn members keeps growing with over <a href="https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">690 million</a> profiles currently on the platform. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Now is the time to get on LinkedIn—but you can’t create just any type of content for your audience. Your content has to be captivating, original, and engagement-worthy. So, how do you create LinkedIn content that captivates your audience?</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Don’t forget LinkedIn is social media</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I often hear that LinkedIn is a B2B platform, so the content can’t be funny/filled with humor/silly (insert adjective here [   ]).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I don’t agree with this statement. Because LinkedIn is a social media platform—and people are engaging on the platform to (1) build a community, (2) make connections, or (3) get known and sell a service. It’s also a platform to build your thought-leadership (or personal brand). It can be used to highlight your authority on a subject, stand out in your industry, and make industry connections.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn is social. And because it’s a social platform—people want to talk with people. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/human-centered-content/">Human-centered content.</a> Keep this in mind as you create LinkedIn content that will perform well. So, what are a few examples of content that will captivate your audience on LinkedIn?</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3441" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/quote_Resource-banner-1024x383.png" alt="How to create a LinkedIn post that will captivate your audience" width="1024" height="383" />\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">4 ways to captivate your audience on LinkedIn</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s time to enlighten, entertain, and connect with people. Here are four ways to captivate your audience and get more attention on LinkedIn.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Share a story.</strong> Storytelling is a powerful content format. Humans have been telling stories for centuries—and it\'s a strong method to present a topic, lesson, or new idea engagingly and easily. Storytelling content on LinkedIn continues to bring high engagement and clicks. Also, sharing a story shows your personality. People need to trust you to buy from you—and LinkedIn provides an outlet for your audience to connect to you on a deeper level; to see your value and interests. This builds trust with your audience.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Show your personality.</strong> We all have something worth saying. And we all don’t say it in the same way. Don’t be afraid to show your personality on LinkedIn. If you’re funny, share a joke. Make sure your copywriting pairs to your voice. If you’re able to achieve this, your audience will resonate with YOU.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Hook them.</strong> Let’s talk about captivating copywriting in your LinkedIn posts. Because you have less than three seconds to capture the attention of your audience before they scroll down the page. It’s all about the hook and the initial message. That first sentence in your LinkedIn post is very important because they need to show the interest/value/takeaway/benefit in a catchy, quick sentence.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Simplify your message.</strong> Write your content for humans. Speak like your audience and create content that is digestible and easy to read. Think simplified. Don’t over complicate your message in the content—and if above all else, only write about one specific topic. Become very niched in your LinkedIn content, so that there is no doubt about what your authority content is covering.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s time to captivate your audience with crafty LinkedIn posts. Don’t forget that LinkedIn is a social media platform despite primarily being for business to business. That means: People want content they can relate to—storytelling, personality, and helpful takeaways—to highlight their feed. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Take an extra effort when you\'re writing content to make sure that it\'s captivating.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">To keep reading about LinkedIn Marketing:</span></strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<p class="entry-title fusion-post-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/anatomy-linkedin-post/">The Anatomy of a Perfect LinkedIn Post</a></span></strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/linkedin/"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: optima;">LinkedIn Marketing For Small Business Owners &amp; Solopreneurs</span></a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

All content and opinions are his own.</span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As we head toward the half-way point of 2020, it seems a good time to reflect on the past six months and evaluate where we go from here. The renewable energy sector, like most industries, has not been able to avoid significant disruption from COVID-19 with projects put on-hold, national tenders postponed, and the day-to-day development of new projects brought to a standstill. In this article, we provide you with the trends in Environmental Energy to watch out for in 2021.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In its latest update, the<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update/2020-and-2021-forecast-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IEA</a> has forecasted a 13% reduction in new renewable energy capacity additions in 2020 compared to 2019. The impact of COVID-19 is telling when you consider that this is the first decline in additional renewable capacity since 2000.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3417" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/new_Resource-banner.png" alt="Trends in Environmental Energy to watch out for in 2021" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Despite this, most European countries now appear to have successfully managed the outbreak and normal service is, slowly but surely, resuming. It’s still too early to say if there will be any negative long-term impact on the sector but the reality of climate change has not disappeared, and thus the requirement for rapid development of clean energy technologies. With this in mind, here are three trends that we expect to be significant in 2021.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: optima;">Green hydrogen begins its ascent</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Green hydrogen has long been thought as a key component to achieving major reductions in global carbon emissions. It has been held back; however, due to technological challenges related to its use and the cost of its production. Green hydrogen can be up to <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/green-hydrogen-cheaper-than-unabated-fossil-fuel-h2-by-2030-hydrogen-council/2-1-741658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four times</a> as expensive as grey hydrogen, which is produced by steam reforming natural gas.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis which is powered by renewable energy sources. Currently, excess renewable electricity is used to power electrolysers which is the only way green hydrogen can be created competitively.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">However, renewable electricity is getting cheaper and is now at a point in many regions, where it no longer needs government support. This should lead to two eventualities which will drive support for the green hydrogen industry. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Firstly, cheaper renewable electricity will lead to a more cost competitive green hydrogen which will also drive uptake in the market. In addition to this, as renewable electricity no longer needs government support to develop, Europe’s leaders will turn their attention to the two other pillars of decarbonization, namely transport and heat.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">These sectors have not enjoyed the same success as renewable electricity to date and uptake of electric vehicles and heat pumps, for example, has been limited. In particular, the heavy goods transportation and industrial process heat sectors have struggled to decarbonize due to inadequate technologies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Green hydrogen has been penned as the solution to decarbonize these sector’s, but poor economic viability has prevented its uptake. Governments across Europe are currently subsidizing electric vehicles and heat pumps and green hydrogen is long overdue for some support to assist with its deployment.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;"><b>Renewable tender prices potentially stabilize short-term</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In the past few years, news headlines about renewable energy projects tended to have a common theme. The auction price delivered was either a new all-time low for the specific country or a record low price for a specific technology. Portugal was the winner in the back end of last year with<a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/07/31/portuguese-auction-attracts-world-record-bid-of-e14-8-mwh-for-solar/#:~:text=It\'s%20official%2C%20almost.,0.016%20per%20kilowatt%2Dhour)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> PV Magazine</a> declaring, <i>“Portuguese auction attracts world record bid of €14.8/MWh for solar”.</i></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This is clearly great news for the industry and the consumer — cheaper costs will drive more uptake and the consumer will see the benefits on their electricity bill. But will we see these same headlines announcing new price records in 2021?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s safe to say that COVID-19 will have an impact on auction tender prices in the short-term. Manufacturing of components required for solar and wind farms has been disrupted which could lead to supply constraints. This would inevitability put a premium on some equipment which would have a negative impact on upcoming auction prices.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A similar theme could be seen with regard to project financing rates. Financing rates for solar and wind farms has been all-time lows due to a low interest rate environment coupled with ever maturing and reliable technologies. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">However, Covid-19 has created a new uncertainty. This uncertainty will surely have an impact on the required returns by banks, institutional, and private equity investors. If the virus remains a threat in 2021, rates of return will need to incorporate a contingency for the impact of a new virus outbreak. If a project in construction goes into lockdown or loses access to materials due to a lockdown in another country, the impact on an investor\'s IRR could be significant. This risk will need to be built into the investors return requirement which, in turn, will increase bid prices.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s likely that these impacts on the sector will be short-term and that we will see new records in auction bid prices in the near future, but for the moment, these headlines might be few and far between.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">A turning point for renewable subsidization costs</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The rapid development of the renewable energy sector in the past 20-years has been impressive but wouldn’t have been possible without government support. Through various types of subsidization schemes, governments across the globe have promoted renewable energy. Many believe this was a necessary cost that all energy consumers have had to bear to ensure a clean energy future.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">However, we’re now close to reaching a turning point. Whereas, in the past 20-years, renewable energy levies on consumer bills have largely trended upwards, 2021 could signal the start of a downward trend. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In Germany, a major proponent of early renewables adoption, the renewable levy (EEG) is forecast to peak at ~ €70/MWh in 2021, according to<a href="https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1594194/german-renewables-levy-peak-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Agora Energiewende.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Post 2021, the levy is expected to gradually reduce due to the first generation of wind turbines that were heavily subsidized in the early noughties, rolling off the payment scheme. This will be welcoming news for consumers in Germany, and across Europe, where similar schemes are reaching peak cost.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Read additional content on the clean energy and environmental technology industry.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-clean-energy/">Content Marketing for Clean Energy, Renewable Energy, and Green Energy Companies</a></span></strong></li>\r\n \t<li><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/berlin-environmental-startups/">15 Innovative Berlin Environmental Startups Tackling Climate Change</a></span></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container][fusion_builder_container hundred_percent="no" hundred_percent_height="no" hundred_percent_height_scroll="no" hundred_percent_height_center_content="yes" equal_height_columns="no" menu_anchor="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" status="published" publish_date="" class="" id="" link_color="" link_hover_color="" border_color="" border_style="solid" margin_top="" margin_bottom="" padding_top="" padding_right="" padding_bottom="" padding_left="" gradient_start_color="" gradient_end_color="" gradient_start_position="0" gradient_end_position="100" gradient_type="linear" radial_direction="center center" linear_angle="180" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="center center" background_repeat="no-repeat" fade="no" background_parallax="none" enable_mobile="no" parallax_speed="0.3" background_blend_mode="none" video_mp4="" video_webm="" video_ogv="" video_url="" video_aspect_ratio="16:9" video_loop="yes" video_mute="yes" video_preview_image="" filter_hue="0" filter_saturation="100" filter_brightness="100" filter_contrast="100" filter_invert="0" filter_sepia="0" filter_opacity="100" filter_blur="0" filter_hue_hover="0" filter_saturation_hover="100" filter_brightness_hover="100" filter_contrast_hover="100" filter_invert_hover="0" filter_sepia_hover="0" filter_opacity_hover="100" filter_blur_hover="0" type="legacy"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type="1_1" layout="1_1" spacing="" center_content="no" link="" target="_self" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" hover_type="none" border_color="" border_style="solid" border_position="all" border_radius="" box_shadow="no" dimension_box_shadow="" box_shadow_blur="0" box_shadow_spread="0" box_shadow_color="" box_shadow_style="" padding_top="" padding_right="" padding_bottom="" padding_left="" margin_top="" margin_bottom="" background_type="single" gradient_start_color="" gradient_end_color="" gradient_start_position="0" gradient_end_position="100" gradient_type="linear" radial_direction="center center" linear_angle="180" background_color="" background_image="" background_image_id="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" background_blend_mode="none" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" filter_type="regular" filter_hue="0" filter_saturation="100" filter_brightness="100" filter_contrast="100" filter_invert="0" filter_sepia="0" filter_opacity="100" filter_blur="0" filter_hue_hover="0" filter_saturation_hover="100" filter_brightness_hover="100" filter_contrast_hover="100" filter_invert_hover="0" filter_sepia_hover="0" filter_opacity_hover="100" filter_blur_hover="0" last="true" border_sizes_top="0" border_sizes_bottom="0" border_sizes_left="0" border_sizes_right="0" first="true"][fusion_imageframe image_id="3704|large" max_width="" sticky_max_width="" style_type="" blur="" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align_medium="none" align_small="none" align="center" margin_top="" margin_right="" margin_bottom="" margin_left="" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" lightbox_image_id="" alt="" link="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/b2b-marketing-next/" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" sticky_display="normal,sticky" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" filter_hue="0" filter_saturation="100" filter_brightness="100" filter_contrast="100" filter_invert="0" filter_sepia="0" filter_opacity="100" filter_blur="0" filter_hue_hover="0" filter_saturation_hover="100" filter_brightness_hover="100" filter_contrast_hover="100" filter_invert_hover="0" filter_sepia_hover="0" filter_opacity_hover="100" filter_blur_hover="0"]https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/29_Email-banner-1024x341.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

And to capture that information at the beginning.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I encourage you to start sooner rather than later with this nurturing journey and lead generation strategy.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Don’t over complicate it</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Many marketing teams don’t jump on this lead generation opportunity simply because of TIME, NO IDEAS, UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORTANCE…. #insertexcusehere</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But I want to make something clear in this blog post. Your first content asset piece for the top of the funnel doesn’t have to be complicated.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It doesn’t have to be a robust ebook guide starting at 5,000 words.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It doesn’t have to be a two-hour webinar on a complicated topic that you can’t get your product lead to commiting to scheduling time to attend.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It can simply be a content type like an Infographic or a checklist. It can be simple.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But most of all—it has to come from a place of value. It has to be valuable to your audience, and it has to be directly linked to a specific pain point or challenge of your ideal audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3409" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/snippet_Resource-banner.png" alt="Blog post on typical content assets to fill the top of the funnel" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And honestly, once you’ve developed that one content asset opt-in. You are <i>golden</i> for the next quarter—and you can position the majority of your content awareness efforts to pushing traffic towards that download piece.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Typical content assets to fill the top of the funnel</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Are you ready to commit to creating a content asset to jump start your lead generation strategy? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Great, I\'m proud that you’ve moved it up in your content priority timeline.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">There are many different types of content assets that are great for the top of the funnel. As we know, the top of the funnel customers are stuck in “awareness”. They’re having challenges, pains, and emotions, but they haven’t quite understood that there is a possible <i>solution</i> to solve what they’re experiencing. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">They’re in the investigation process—and because of this, they’re asking themselves specific questions that are within this “awareness” level.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What are those questions?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This is a great question to work on answering during your <i>Intelligence Gathering</i> meeting with your c-suite, sales team, and current customers. What are your customers asking at this level in the journey?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I stress this point because it\'s essential to creating a content asset piece that resonates with your audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Don’t put effort into something that won’t bring results. Avoid the guesswork and gather intelligence for your topic.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You have your topic, now what are typical content assets that work well for the top of the funnel efforts? Here they are:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Infographics</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Mini-guides</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Checklists to improve something (i.e. think specific challenge)</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Entry-level topical webinar</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Quizzes</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Mini-email courses</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And if you’re still not sure, ask your audience. Ask your audience <a href="https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/25-social-media-prompts-that-get-the-conversation-going/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what type of content assets</a> they like to consume. Granted we can guess based on B2B industry experience (i.e. checklists, guides, webinars)—but poll tools on social media platforms like LinkedIn now provide us with a very easy and quick way to engage our audience.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

By utilizing the best social media platforms for B2B marketing, you can strengthen your message, broaden your reach, and put your brand, product, or service in front of the right corporate audience.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Best social media platforms for B2B marketing</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Each social media platform has its own style, functions, benefits, and limitations. Instead of throwing time and money into the wind to see what works, we recommend you focus your B2B social media strategy on the two best social media platforms for B2B marketing: LinkedIn and Twitter.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">With over <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/linkedin-statistics/">500 million users</a>, LinkedIn has been developed specifically for B2B industries. Twitter is the standout when it comes to a strong presence of B2B tech thought-leaders and other niche topic advocates among its user base.</span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Both Twitter and LinkedIn can be used to fill the top of the funnel, build a social presence, attract an audience, and generate leads for your B2B business. Let’s take a look at the advantages of each.</span></blockquote>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why is LinkedIn good for B2B?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Establish your business as a thought-leader.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">B2B experts use LinkedIn to share knowledge and build peer networks. You can use LinkedIn to connect and develop relationships with these people and showcase your own expertise through the variety of content formats available on LinkedIn. By doing so, you’ll immerse yourself and your brand in industry news and trends, and demonstrate leadership within your field.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Generate high-quality leads.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn makes up <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/linkedin-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over half</a> of all social traffic to B2B websites and blogs. As one of the best social media platforms for B2B marketing, it’s the platform of choice for B2B personas, professionals, and decision-makers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Start your lead generation efforts on LinkedIn and fill the top of the funnel with quality leads in your specific field. Share original content and drive traffic towards your website through content upgrades and opt-in downloads.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Organic content performs well.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">While paid campaigns are becoming the only way to cut through the clutter on most other social channels, LinkedIn’s algorithms still favor organic activity such as engagement and interaction. You can boost your reach simply by producing credible and relevant content that encourages conversation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As your content gains traction, it has the potential to trend in your industry hashtags, which will help you reach and connect with even more people in your target audience. For this reason, using the right industry-specific hashtags is key.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Build a reputation and nurture long-term relationships.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Buying cycles tend to be long for B2B industries, so markets are challenged with keeping prospects entertained and engaged over longer periods of time. LinkedIn is the best social media platform for B2B lead nurturing, as it allows you to build authentic, professional, long-term relationships and maintain them. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Your organization’s top leaders can build a reputation of trust and authenticity with their audience by engaging through their personal LinkedIn profiles. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2020/01/22/how-to-utilize-linkedin-in-2020-to-4x-your-revenue/#62d47589177c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">94%</a> of B2B influencers creating content on LinkedIn would surely agree that LinkedIn is truly a powerhouse for B2B marketing potential.

The software, cybersecurity, and deep tech industries are particularly well represented. You can gain invaluable insights that you just don’t see on other platforms.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">No matter how niche your B2B product or service is, you’re sure to find communities of people on Twitter interested in talking about it. While many of these people may be micro influencers with a smaller presence, their audiences can be incredibly loyal and engaged.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Deep-dive into discussions.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Twitter provides a way to dive deeper into conversations about trends, innovations, and news relevant to your field. The thoughts and opinions of your potential leads are much more accessible on Twitter than any other platform, and anyone can contribute to the discussion.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">By adding your voice, you can build a reputation for engaging in rich conversation and forge a strong position for your brand as a relevant player and contributor in your industry.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Generate new leads simply by engaging.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Twitter’s short, engaging tweets and fast-paced, conversational nature provides an ongoing stream of opportunities to increase interactions and build a following, which ultimately generates new potential leads. Ask questions, reply to mentions, retweet relevant content to engage with other users and give your B2B brand a human aspect.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Other types of social media formats that work well for B2B</span></strong></h2>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">Webinars.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Webinars are incredibly useful for catering to specific audiences, whether it’s pitching to new leads or strengthening existing relationships by providing expertise. The live aspect provides a chance to respond to real time feedback, but you can also record and distribute a webinar for future use.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Webinars are typically easy to produce, and much more affordable than holding in-person meetings, which are restricted by travel costs and other expenses. By eliminating the need for people to travel, you open up the number of people you can reach at once. You can hold a webinar for multiple locations at the same company at the same time.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Live streaming on social media has some similarities but is slightly more relevant for B2C than B2B. The exception is LinkedIn.</span>\r\n<h3><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">YouTube and other video platforms.</span></h3>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Video has become more popular than ever, with <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">88%</a> of marketers who use video believing that it delivers a good return on investment. YouTube is the most widely used platform for video, but LinkedIn and Facebook have also emerged as strong performers for video content.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="size-full wp-image-3355 alignnone" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/annie-spratt-AkftcHujUmk-unsplash-2.jpg" alt="Talking on video online" width="800" height="533" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Video is a powerful tool for building understanding of products and services, making it particularly valuable for B2B organizations to demonstrate the benefits of a corporate offering. It also reduces the volume of incoming customer support requests by providing clients and customers with ways to problem solve independently. It’s an excellent tool for organic growth opportunities, with people twice as likely to share video than any other form of content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Our analysis of the best social media channels for B2B marketing should be taken as a guide only, and shouldn’t deter you from trying other social media channels. Always monitor and evaluate your metrics as you go, so you can see how well your content performs and how effective these channels are for you. With time and experience, you’ll discover which channels are the most appropriate for your B2B business, and which deliver the best ROI.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

With that said, as a B2B company you need to be extending your lead generation efforts to LinkedIn and creating a content strategy to drive awareness &amp; leads through this platform. And that process begins with understanding what content goes viral and knowing the anatomy of a perfect LinkedIn post.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Using LinkedIn to build your personal brand</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn offers several different types of spaces and publishing formats to push your content on the platform. You primarily have company pages and individual personal profiles.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In this context, we’re focusing on personal LinkedIn profiles, because leveraging your “human side” and building a personal brand will elevate the overall status of your business.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And this is because humans resonate with humans.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Humans trust, build connections with, and buy from humans. People resonate with people—and not with faceless brands.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Of course, you can work to humanize your brand. But I have found that building your personal LinkedIn profile is a more effective method for lead generation efforts.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">What content can you create on LinkedIn?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn has many different content formats to try. And depending on your audience, a specific format type might work very well for you.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Organically, you can publish articles, long-form content posts, videos, audio snippets, LinkedIn groups, and even use your personal profile to showcase your content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But through our LinkedIn research, my agency has found that textual content posts are more loved and rank the highest.</span>\r\n\r\n<iframe title="Embedded post" src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6669487430522961920" width="504" height="505" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Learn the anatomy of a perfect LinkedIn post</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If you want to create content that resonates on LinkedIn, you want to establish a few best practices it organize and structure a content text post.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Remember the chosen content topic plays a strong role in its viral worthiness. If the content topic isn’t aligned with your target audience, it’s not going to be loved—or the wrong audience will even engage with it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Note these key parts to a LinkedIn post:\r\n</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A “hook” first sentence—or simply leverage the power of copywriting.</strong> Capture your audience’s attention with a fact, a question, or a ‘wow’ moment to get them to digest the rest of the content post.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Use tasteful emojis to break up the text.</strong> I use “tasteful” here because we have to remember that we’re on a business to business platform. Use emojis that make sense for your audience and help convey the emotion of the subject.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Think short and digestible.</strong> Humans scroll on LinkedIn quickly, just like any other platform. Make the content easy to scan with the eyes by breaking up the text into short sentences and indented paragraphs.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Don’t forget industry hashtags.</strong> Every post should have relevant industry hashtags to offer the opportunity for your content to trend in a specific industry. This is key to narrowing down your lead generation efforts.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Avoid outbound links.</strong> The platform loves engagement—and they want YOU to stay on their platform, so they can make money. Limit outbound links to the comment section of your LinkedIn posts.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s a continuous process to tweak your LinkedIn posts to perfection.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Remember LinkedIn is a social media platform, and they can become the next Facebook business at any time. Meaning, you don\'t have control over the engagement and reach of your LinkedIn content. That control will always be with LinkedIn even if you learn industry best practices and techniques. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Leverage the potential of LinkedIn—but don’t forget to incorporate a valuable content opt-in piece with every LinkedIn post to jump start your lead generation efforts off the platform.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To keep reading about LinkedIn Marketing:</span></strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<p class="entry-title fusion-post-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="25" data-lineheight="27px"><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/create-linkedin-content-that-will-captivate-your-audience/">How To Create A LinkedIn Post That Will Captivate Your Audience</a></span></strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/linkedin/"><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn Marketing For Small Business Owners &amp; Solopreneurs</span></strong></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

But more often than not, we forget one of the most important pieces to the B2B marketing content creation process. Distribution.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content creation is nothing without distribution. And if you’re not taking the time to create a distribution strategy to perform after your B2B content marketing strategy, then what’s the point. What’s the point if no one <i>ever </i>reads your content? Because surely, if no one knows that you posted the content, how will people read it?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A content distribution strategy is important for all companies at all levels of the content creation process—from early startup to seasoned content creator.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But for companies that have been producing content for years, they already have the organic upper hand. And they can see which content gains traction to promote it with a budget. And they already have a list of dedicated followers to distribute to and promote their content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Let’s say you don’t have a sturdy email list. Or a large following on a social media platform. Where should you focus your attention? What are the best practices for B2B marketing to promote content?</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Your B2B content marketing promotion strategy</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I’m a believer in strategy simplicity and consistency. And refining your outreach strategy to just a few basic blocks that work and bring you leads or build brand awareness. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>How to promote B2B content</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I have found that LinkedIn, content syndication, and email are a few of the best methods to promote B2B content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn is the social media platform for B2B audiences. And it still has relatively untapped potential. Audiences have grown organically and exponentially on LinkedIn. And LinkedIn for MTC is a major traffic driver to our landing pages, content downloads, and blog posts. Remember to publish your blog content on LinkedIn at least six times throughout 60-days. And try these few points for maximum impact;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/repurpose-content/">Reword the long-form content into shorter-form content posts</a> that build upon the topic,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Turn some of the posts into video snippets,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Repost highlights or pieces of the original post on LinkedIn Pulse,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Private message the new post to all the contacts in your business niche, and </span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Ask employees and the c-suite to repost the content in their feeds.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Next, with your content, you always want to hit the low-hanging fruits of B2B content promotion. And the easiest method is with organic and free content syndication or reposting content onto websites that broadcast your content to a larger audience to be found. These websites include;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">LinkedIn Pulse,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Medium Blog,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Mix.com,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Quora.com,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Question websites related to your niche (i.e. Reddit),</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.business2community.com/">Business2Community,</a> and</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Flipboard.com.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">These websites are just a few. An expert note, always review the editorial guidelines of these websites to absolutely make sure that you can publish content freely and that it doesn’t have to be original content.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The last method is email. Email will always be your number one organic content broadcaster. When social media and third-party websites change their strategy (or go away altogether), email is something that can respectively remain yours to control. Constantly aim to grow your email list through content asset downloads and creative ideas. Nurture the list with your blog content as it gets published—and as your email list grows segment that list into audience journey levels and specific challenges to practice sending them the right content at the right time.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Best practices for B2B marketing to promote content</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Best practices are always changing, so make sure to follow B2B content marketing thought leaders to always know the latest trends and strategies that work. Content promotion is the forgotten step-sister of the B2B content marketing strategy. Remember her and develop a simple approach strategy to promote your B2B content through LinkedIn, content syndication, and email.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="single solid" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_size="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It’s a tough question truly because both sides of the argument have merit. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And the most annoying answer to this question is, well, “both.” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Both the quantity of content and the quality of the content produced is the correct answer. When we begin with a new client, this is always one of the first questions they ask.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And they should! Frankly, concluding this question will undoubtedly affect the execution and the success of your B2B content marketing strategy.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">How much b2b content: a delicate balance between the two</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The answer to the question is “both.” Your content marketing strategy has to be a delicate balance between quality content and an efficient quantity of content to become noticed.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">First, let’s prove that you’ve established a quality content engine. And that you’re creating all your content with a purpose.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This means that the blog topics (and other forms of content) topics that you’ve chosen to develop are rooted in customer intent and needs. You can name the level of the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience journey</a> associated with your topic piece and you can identify the question that it’s answering. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Congratulations. You’re creating quality content—and because of this, you’ll have a stronger return on the time and money spent in developing content.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Now, we can talk about quantity.</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Quantity matters. Because you have to have a sturdy database of content to A) be picked up by Google in volumes, or B) thoroughly answer the questions of your target audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Customers have more than one question. And you have to provide multiple answers. And sometimes answers are even in multiple layers. Customers will start with a top-level question, but then they will dig deeper for more thorough answers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Would you rather them dig deeper for those answers on your website or a competitor’s?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This is where pillar posts and <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/topic-cluster-content/">topic clusters</a> can be so powerful. In their structural nature, they encourage the reader to dig deeper. And if the reader continues to have their questions answered, that builds trust, authority, and your company as the go-to resource for the topic.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">How much content should you create?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Yes, both matters. But that doesn’t mean that it’s easy to put a number on it. Many factors are coming into play for this special number to be determined. Its factors like “how competitive are your keywords”, “how competitive are your industry topics,” or “how quickly do you have to show ROI?” </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Before I get to the magic number, I encourage all clients to start with content sooner and not later. Because organic content marketing needs time to establish a search engine footprint and to attract attention. Sometimes up to 8-months! And if you’re creating pillar posts and topic clusters, you’re even more likely to rank higher and quicker. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Even if you can’t commit to this number, it doesn’t mean to NOT produce content. Keep producing quality content and consistently. Even if that consistency is one time a month.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But let’s put a number on it. I would say that you need to be consistently producing three to four pieces of content weekly for up to eight months. It’s this mix of quality and quantity content that provided <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-case-study-saas-startup/">our cybersecurity client</a> with over 10,000 page views within the first three months.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">In the beginning, when no one knows you, quantity is even more important.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I consult my clients on trying to <strong>produce between <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three and four pieces of content</a> a week in the beginning.</strong> You have to make an organic impact. Nobody knows you. You’ll see the most return if you commit to consistent content execution with content that remains relevant and quality. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And remember that there are other very important components of an organic growth strategy that aren\'t just website content. It also includes link building efforts and PR. I encourage clients to begin these types of efforts within the first six months of their content marketing strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But for now, commit to three and four pieces of content weekly for the first eight months and you’ll be in a good starting place.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="single solid" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_size="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

In between school closures, trade show cancellations, and quarantines, the current situation can make any small business feel anxious. Worried about the future. Worried about financial impacts. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As a solar company, it most likely means that COVID-19 has canceled upcoming trade shows and your in-person consultations have been postponed, and you may have even temporarily sent your staff home because of health concerns.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">There is no doubt that this is a tough time for all of us. But I encourage you that now is NOT THE TIME to stop marketing. Use educational content to keep ties and form empathy with your customers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This is a huge opportunity for you to jump ahead of the competition. While other solar companies are hesitating, use this opportunity to get ahead of them. Make yourself known as a compassionate and educative solar company, improve your brand image, and remain present with customers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Let’s get real. If you’re able to <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/solar-companies-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage content marketing</a> in this way, at the end of this, you’ll have a much better opportunity to bounce back.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 18pt;">How can you crisis-proof your solar business?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It’s time to think through the uncertainty and brainstorm ideas on how to show up for your customers and use content to remain present.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Reformat solar financial plans</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Customers want options at this time. They’re uncertain about the future, and they’re reluctant to invest in a high-cost asset like a solar panel system. Ease their worry by offering flexible payment plans. Instead offer the option to subscribe to a solar panel system, or pay inflexible, smaller payments over a longer period. You might find that customers don’t even take the deal—but the fact that you offered builds trust.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Keep showing up</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As mentioned, it’s time to show up for your customers both online, in writing, and on social media. Don’t let them forget about you. Open the conversation for questions and keep providing solar education through social posts. At this time, I would suggest making content 95% educational-driven and the rest promotion. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Move solar consultations to video conferencing</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">There are a plethora of video conferencing software on the market. You can choose from Zoom, Apple video, or try Facebook conferencing. As you’re likely already on Facebook, have them connect with you there and to finalize their solar consultations on video.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Be transparent about the situation and empathize with your customers</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The most difficult task during COVID-19 is messaging. How can you convey your business’s message both ethically but still also make sales. It’s going to be hard to sell anything at this moment. Your messaging should be empathetic towards the conversation but also solution-driven. Tell customers your action plan on solar consultations and visits. Reassure them that it’s business as usual. Offer a solar subscription plan, or refinancing option. And above all else, don’t stop marketing and communicating with your customers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Yes, your business will slow, but if you do this, your business will come out on top.

As a small business owner, you might still be wrapping your head around the reality of how the COVID-19 health epidemic will impact your business’s financial bottom line. And it might very well. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Business might get slower. In-person customer meetings will go virtual, and it might be harder to close solar deals. People will simply have other thoughts in their head than their solar panel installations. So, how do you keep the sales conversation strong? How do you remain present in the minds of your warm leads? How do you keep people thinking about going solar? Here’s the answer: leverage the power of content marketing.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Grow your current content’s impact</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing is a strategy to build awareness, generate new solar leads, and keep current prospects engaged. It’s a long-term strategy, but it has long-lasting effects. If you’ve already been leveraging content marketing, you will start to see a spike in your digital content traffic over the coming weeks as more people transition online. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">My predictions are that you’ll see;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">an increase in organic traffic to blog posts, and</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">more engagement on social media and interaction with your posts.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As people sit at home, they will want even more access to information and entertainment. How can you give that to them? For example, you could develop;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">a video series on the effects of climate change and why solar is important,</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">a webinar on the financial benefits of transitioning to solar, or</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">a weekly FAQ Facebook live session covering commonly asked solar questions.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As a solar company, you have the opportunity to leverage the current situation and remain present. Don’t let the educational conversations stop; instead, transition those conversations online and amplify. With more people at home, it only makes sense that internet engagement will go up over the next few weeks. </span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">Right now has never been a better time for content</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content is the backbone of your business. As you’re seeing in this current health emergency, older traditional ways of marketing and sales like door-to-door visits and home trade shows are becoming obsolete. And you can frankly see the financial impact of those event cancellations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If your strategy is solely reliant on these types of lead acquisition methods, how can you stay competitive?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content can help diversify your lead generation strategy. More and more people are asking Google their solar questions and your website needs to jump to the top of those search inquiries (and not to your competitors) with the answers. This is done with relevant and question-answer-based content. It’s never been a better time to incorporate content into your lead generation strategy.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;">How to get started with content</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Everything in marketing starts with goals—and goals are the framework for shaping a strategy that leads to outcomes. At MTC, we provide you with a strategic framework that incorporates industry best standards and innovative ideas. We offer a <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/solar-provider/"><i>content lead generation package</i></a> that provides you with all the important pieces of content consulting, planning, and content creation for solar companies.

It’s also about SEO structure and strategy—and one cannot exist without the other. We call this topic cluster content.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">SEO and content are like “two peas in a pod”. They’re bound together. They have similar principles, and they rely on each other. To develop an effective organic content marketing strategy, you must organize your digital content into pillar posts and topic clusters to rank on Google search.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;"><b>What is topic cluster content?</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">An effective topic cluster strategy can send your website to the top of search results. The strategy is comprised of multiple content pieces (i.e. blog posts, landing pages, product pages, or FAQ pages) that live on your website and are linked together by a pillar topic piece.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A pillar topic piece (also known as a cornerstone piece) is the foundation of your content. It’s the main topic conversation driver, and it’s usually a broader topic like “what is solar energy?”, “data analytics solving x,y&amp;z in environmental tech”, or “solar basics 101”. They provide a contextual introduction to a main topic that you wish to rank for and be known for on Google.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A pillar topic piece is at the center of each topic cluster—and a <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/topic-clusters-on-site-seo/319109/#close" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">topic cluster</a> is made up of multiple topics that dive deeper into the subject and act as subtopics. Generally, these topic clusters are rooted to a long-tail keyword that has a smaller search volume but is still relevant to the audience persona.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3022 alignleft" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-09-at-14.16.59.png" alt="" width="223" height="340" />Here to the left is MTC | The Content Agency’s topic cluster strategy for the broad keyword topic: <b>B2B content marketing</b>. We’re developing key topic cluster pieces around a large topic pillar post on this keyword.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">We chose this topic because we wish to rank for B2B content marketing—and we want to be considered experts in combining both marketing and sales efforts to achieve results.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As a team, we’ve also developed topic cluster content for our clients.</span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3021 alignright" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-09-at-14.16.44.png" alt="" width="236" height="264" /></span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"> You can see this example to the right.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Our solar energy client is a solar residential company, and they work directly with customers in their local area. We developed a pillar topic piece on the keyword “solar power 101” which had a large enough search volume to be competitive—and it acts as a first touch point to educating customers on the ‘awareness’ level of the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience journey</a>. Below the pillar post are the cluster content topics that support the main theme.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Overall, pillar and topic cluster content help you lay the foundation and conversation with Google. By interlinking these key topics together, you are telling Google the context of your website, why it’s important, and the audience to show it to (i.e. research the <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/2017/06/08/using-latent-semantic-indexing-to-boost-your-seo-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latent-semantic-indexing algorithm</a>). Google wants to provide its searchers with relevant and useful information—and a topic cluster content strategy is an effective method for you to help Google do this.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Lastly, a pillar post isn’t just any regular piece of content. It’s a long-form piece of content close to 1,500 words—and has substance, depth of knowledge, and relevance to the topic. It’s an expert piece with all the key important topics on the subject to make known to your audience.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima;"><b>How to build a cluster</b></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You have to start somewhere—and it might be to your surprise, you don’t start with the content. <strong>You start with people.</strong> </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Just as we stated in our <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing strategy article</a>, a pillar post and topic clusters begin on relevant pain points (or challenges) of your target audience. They have relevance—and they’re key questions and topics your ideal audience is discussing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once you’ve developed your buyer persona and deep-dived into these challenges, you now have starting topics. Take these topics and perform basic Google keyword research and determine which topics have a decent search volume and a relatively manageable competitiveness. From this data, you can develop your pillar topic and its keyword.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Next, use tools like <a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Answer the Public</a> and <a href="https://lsigraph.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LSI graph</a> to brainstorm all the long-tail cluster topics that you can use to support your pillar post. This is your topic cluster content strategy. Finally, combine that structure and map it out in a free tool like <a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindmeister</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">An effective strategy is always the start of any high-converting lead generation approach. Make sure pillar posts and topic cluster content are at the heart of your organic content marketing strategy. </span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Don’t waste your time making mistakes that can have lasting negative effects on your company’s lead generation. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/strategy/">Hire a content strategist to develop a strategy topic structure for you—and convert your new customers that much quicker.</a></span></strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

We’ve written as a team over 80,000 words for our clients.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As we move into a second year, I look to position MTC as a content marketing agency on the very frontier of industry best practices and methods that work. To serve our clients even better, I\'ll start to niche us into key areas and establish our brand as an expert.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I’ll learn to talk the talk, hear the melodies of the sector, and form a strategy around your unique industry needs. To better serve our B2B clients, I need to talk to you and understand your industry so that I can give you a specific go-to solution that performs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I\'ll continue to serve all B2B clients in need—but as MTC moves forward, I\'ll build our portfolio and service offerings specifically for environmental technology brands.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I’ll develop content marketing solutions that aid the renewable energy technology sector in solar and wind. And deep dive even further into B2B smart tech solutions that allow these industries to accelerate and thrive.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As the founder, I’ll take a consultant first approach. Yes, we\'re a content marketing agency and able to serve you in multiple facets. But at the center of this agency is a content marketing expert. And it\'s my job to provide you with the very best professional insight, industry best practices, and advice in content marketing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I’ll soon launch a content marketing strategy package specific to the tech industry. It\'ll form a strong foundation and structure for your performance, and you\'ll have access to expert content writers from your industry to realize the content within the strategy. I understand that this is fundamentally important for B2B technology companies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I have many exciting plans for MTC in the coming year. Thank you for following along—and I hope to partner with you on a project soon.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

To remain competitive, you need to adopt solar content marketing tactics.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Without a doubt, solar power is gaining public awareness and consumers are looking to capture it as a clean, affordable electricity source. Solar power content marketing is an effective strategy for you as the solar energy provider to generate more leads.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">According to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEA</a>, the renewable energy economy is set to expand—and more than double in its capacity over the next five years. More than half of that expansion will be due to solar PV growth.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As solar power becomes more popular and consumers search for their local trusted cleaner energy provider—they will also look to be educated, informed, and guided in making the best buying decision for their household. This is where solar power content marketing is a strong strategy to generate prospects for your solar company.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">What is content marketing?</span></strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing is a <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy</a> used to attract, nurture, and retain your ideal customer audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A collection of content pieces (i.e. blog posts, emails, social media, downloads, and more) are created to educate your customers about solar energy by the means of quality, relevant, and helpful information.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As you attract new prospects and fill the top of the funnel, you’ll nurture those prospects with relevant information to determine if they’re a match for your services.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing is a great way to quantify prospects—and check to see if they’re engaging with the information and ready to move forward with the sales team.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For example, if a prospect read five blog articles, opened six educational emails, and downloaded your ebook—it would be safe to say they’re very interested in solar PV technology, and they’re worth the sales team’s time and attention to connect.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This is where content marketing can be a great benefit to sales and marketing alignment—and working together as a team, you can close more and higher-quality leads.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing is a viable strategy for all levels of the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audience journey</a>, and it will help you even keep clients longer; after they’ve purchased. You’ll continue to give them quality information and resources to maintain their solar power system.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why is content great for solar companies</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You might think that content marketing is just a buzzword—but it\'s one of the oldest sales/marketing strategies in the playbook.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Building relationships, maintaining relationships, helping customers, answering questions, building trust and authenticity….these are all the fundamental principles of why content marketing works so well.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But many industries tryout content marketing—how is solar power content marketing particularly great for you?</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Content answers questions.</strong> Customers looking to invest in solar are never absent of questions. They have uncertainties about the price, how the installation works, the environmental impact, and they all turn to Google (or a similar search engine) to find the answers to their questions. You want your solar company’s blog to pop to the top of the page for your local community.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The environment is a hot topic.</strong> The news is exploding with topics regarding the environment—making the timing a perfect opportunity to use PR and thought-leadership practices to drive traffic.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Solar technology is growing.</strong> The industry is projected to expand in the next five years. At this point, you have less competition on Google to rank and get noticed. Jump on the fast-moving content marketing train before it\'s too late.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Content is a relationship builder.</strong> Your audience is buying a high-cost asset—and they have to trust you before they make the buying decision. Content is a great way to build trust, authenticity, and help them make a well-informed buying decision.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How content can generate prospects for solar</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The job of content is to attract relevant solar customers to your website—and they can come from multiple sources. Typically, the attraction content sources used by solar companies are;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Blog posts</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Email copy</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Social media copy</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Ebooks</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Educational surveys</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Quizzes</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">White papers</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Videos, and more.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But content’s greatest job is to channel those ‘top of the funnel’ prospects through the audience journey towards the sales team as pre-qualified. This is where many, many companies get caught up.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You have to eventually touch each point of the audience journey with relevant content to keep a prospect moving forward.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For example, what content could pair with each audience journey-level?</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Blog posts are used to answer prospect questions looking for key solar questions or keep up-to-date on clean technology news. Blog posts are great for attraction—and top of the funnel needs.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Educational guides, specifically on topics like solar maintenance or installation, would target prospects closer to the ‘sell’. Educational guidebooks are great for consideration—and the middle of the funnel needs.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Testimonials, a cost-saving calculator, or case studies would help prospects make the final decision: “To buy, or not to buy...”</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Referral programs or loyalty programs are a great tool for retaining current customers—and using happy customers as a jumping board to find new customers. We could nestle this in the advocacy level of the audience journey.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Many content marketing strategies forget that they eventually have to touch on all points of the audience journey.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Usually, our solar clients at MTC | The Content Agency begins with blog content, guides, and opt-ins (like a solar calculator) to get started.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">And as our business relationship grows together and we learn more about your needs, we’ll become crystal clear on delivering the best content for these other levels. Read our latest case study with a solar client.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Crafting a solar content marketing strategy</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Do I have you convinced? Content marketing is a viable strategy to consider for your solar company. It will help you generate higher and more quality leads over a longer period. If we decide to partner together on your content marketing project, these are the exact steps that we’ll follow:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Start with goals and expectations.</strong> We have a short 20-minute meeting after the contract is signed to discuss your project expectations and goals. We become crystal clear on this so that we understand how to help you reach your goals.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Audit of your current content.</strong> If you currently have live content, I’ll take a look, review it, look to see how it’s performing, and offer feedback for improvement.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Intelligence gathering meeting.</strong> In this meeting, we’ll hone in on your target audience and audience journey. Content creation needs to have a clear understanding of the needs, challenges, and motivations of the target audience. This will help us create converting content!</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Crafting of the buyer persona, customer journey, and key touchpoints.</strong> We take all that great intelligence—and gather into a clean document as a starting framework for our content development. We’ll pinpoint key themes, interesting topics, and trends at each level of the journey.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Content best practices and structure.</strong> I’ll share with you a Mindmap or a similar tool that helps us map out the content and structure. You’ll see key topics at the center—and sub-topics supporting those larger topics. I call this the Cluster Topic approach. We lastly assign each topic a content “type” (i.e. blog post or social post).</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Content creation.</strong> We have our roadmap—and we’re ready to create content. You can follow the content calendar and plan in an Airtable online calendar we’ll assign to you.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As founder of MTC | The Content Agency, I truly believe in the success of your project, so every content project includes weekly “catchup” meetings and a three-month review. I want to make sure our content efforts are still lined up and in tune with your team.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Are you ready to start with content marketing?</span><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/solar-provider/"> Learn more about our residential solar marketing services.</a></span>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

We reflect on our marketing projects and business goals from this last year. Did we reach our goals? How could we improve in the next year? And most of all, we’re looking ahead to see what the 2020 content marketing trends will be.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for another content marketing trend article, you won’t find it here. As we start to plan our 2020 goals, I know you’ll be looking at marketing trend articles to determine how best to set your strategy in the new year. I’ve seen so many of these types of trend articles over the years, I call most of them superficial.\r\n\r\nThey sometimes give original thought, but for the most part, they\'re regurgitated information spread across multiple blogs. It’s like all these trend articles sit in the breakfast club, have a collective conversation, and then write the same article upon arriving back at home. I’m surprised once in a blue moon by a content marketing expert’s trend expectations, but for the most part, they’re all the same.\r\n<h2>2020 content marketing trends — that will not change</h2>\r\nI love this time of year. I’m one of those weird founders that enjoy sitting down and crafting my 2020 business plan and goals about four months too early. Planning and goal-setting are fun for me. But I realize it’s not for many. As a small business or startup, you’ve heard of <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/">content marketing</a>, and you’re trying to decide if it’s a viable option to incorporate into your business plan in the coming year. I might be biased, but I believe content marketing is one of the best marketing strategies to build a stronger relationship between you and your audience — and to strongly ally your content with the sales team.\r\n\r\nContent marketing is not a new phenomenon. Content marketing is rooted in concepts that have been a part of relationship building, business building, and marketing<em> forever</em>. Storytelling is a form of content marketing. How long have we been telling stories?\r\n\r\nAnd despite new content applications coming to the market (yes, TikTok — talking to you) and new tools and technologies emerging, certain points will never change about content marketing. These points below will always be true.\r\n<h2>Content is about connecting to people.</h2>\r\nStorytelling and giving educational content is about the oldest sales strategy in the playbook. We’ve been telling stories for centuries to teach people, to share information, to make sense of the world, to help people improve, and encourage people towards our point of view. Content like this connects us. It creates a sharing space for a personal exchange of informational helping and supporting. By showing our specific content expertise to the world, we let others know what we’re interested in and what we can offer. We can then connect with others that have similar interests.\r\n<h2>Content sparks intimate conversation.</h2>\r\nWhen is the last time you had a debate? Or you searched on Google to find an answer to your question? Content begins the intimate conversation between you and your audience. You share topics on your expertise, and through your content, you help people with obstacles they’re currently experiencing. As we’re striking close to personal emotions, motives, and pains, content is personal. And because the content is personal, it starts the bridge toward an intimate conversation. Intimate conversation builds trust — and people buy from those they trust.\r\n<h2>Content is only as good as your distribution.</h2>\r\nThis point is less philosophical and more practical. Content is only as good as its distribution, plain and simple. You can have an award-winning piece with practical tips and information for your buyer persona. But if your <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/buyer-persona/">buyer persona</a> isn’t finding that content, how can you connect with them? How can you spark an intimate conversation? As we move into the future, the age-old saying of ‘less is more’ will become more relevant in content marketing. We create less but better content for our audience. And we spend more time distributing it.\r\n<h2>Content builds trust — and trust is better built visually.</h2>\r\nAre you more likely to trust someone you met in a supermarket or someone you met online? Physical and visual interaction with your audience is the ultimate trust builder. This is why sales works so well. Because you make personal contact with someone and you shake their hand. It’s something about that physical touch. It’s a trust factor being built — and people buy from those they trust. Written content is always a great start, but the video trend will continue to build momentum. It’s because video visually and emotionally builds trust quicker with your audience. Content builds trust — and video content strengthens and accelerates that relationship building.\r\n<h2>Content marketing trends that won’t be new</h2>\r\nNot a trend, but rather a reality. Because content marketing plays on the oldest principles in the book of relationship building and connection, it’s no surprise that content marketing will continue to be a needed strategy in your small business or startup strategy playbook. It has striking ROI and positive influence over your audience. As it becomes more popular, it will be harder to stand out and make a presence in your target market with its tactics. It’s never been a better time to jump-start your content marketing strategy and use content to build relationships with your audience.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It continues to be a leading strategy for online businesses to funnel and attract a specific audience. Starting and growing a SaaS startup blog is an intelligent marketing strategy to apply to an early-stage startup.\r\n<blockquote>In the business to the business world, information is key. As much as <a href="https://getgist.com/content-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">96 percent </a>of B2B buyers are consuming information from credible sources before making a buying decision.</blockquote>\r\nProspects are consuming blog posts, influencer content, relevant blog articles, case studies, white papers, and videos to inform their buying decisions. And because of this, B2B marketers have opted for content marketing as a go-to strategy with as much as <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/38-content-marketing-stats-that-every-marketer-needs-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">93 percent </a>of marketers leaving room for it in their strategy.\r\n\r\nAs a SaaS startup, building a blog should be top priority. Crafting a blog content strategy is the first strategic step to attracting and qualifying potential prospects into buying customers. Blogging is a marketing strategy that easily couples with startup business goals like finding leads, building brand awareness, and becoming a thought leader.\r\n<h2>Why Grow a Startup Blog</h2>\r\nContent marketing is marketing that keeps giving. When other forms of marketing tailor off after budgets are spent, content resides on your website continuing to attract prospects. Content provides a startup with four key benefits.\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><b>Builds authority.</b> Blog content is a useful way to display knowledge. Writing a well-informed article with credible links and knowledge is hard work. As a SaaS blog tailors towards a specific topic, the startup’s expertise in the specific field shows off and they’re well on their way to becoming what we marketers say, “an industry thought-leader.” At MTC, we look to build authority in three areas: content marketing strategy and human-centered content creation.</li>\r\n \t<li><b>Blogging provides transparency.</b> Blogging is a great method to start an introductory conversation with a new person. They learn of your interests, your tone, your expertise, and personality. Blogging provides transparency to who you are and what you believe in. And transparency builds trust.</li>\r\n \t<li><b>Blogging starts an online conversation.</b> Humans enjoy engaging with others of similar interests. When a prospect visits your blog, they take a look around, read the content, and form an opinion about you and your startup. A blog is a conversation starter introducing the topics you’re an expert in, where you can provide help and your expertise.</li>\r\n \t<li><b>Business case.</b> Blogging is one of the strongest ROIs for business prospecting, authority building, and search volume ranking. Google ranks quality content that is specific towards a target market and answers their unique challenges and questions. Blogging provides organic traffic to a startup business and service. New prospects to nurture. When more than 50% of organic traffic comes through blog posts, blogging is a great ROI business case.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>How to Grow a Startup Blog</h2>\r\nIt might seem daunting to imagine starting a blog. It’s work. It takes time — and like anything created in business — it should have a solid strategy behind it. Creating a blog without a strategy leads to missed opportunities and frustration.\r\n\r\nWhere do you start with a blog strategy? Here are three quick tips that we approach with every startup client. It’s a progressive approach to content topic generation and structure.\r\n\r\n<b>Befriend your audience.</b> Who is your audience? What are their concerns, challenges, pains, and motivations? Befriending the audience is the first step in generating topic ideas. It sets focus towards that topics that are most beneficial to a target audience.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/8-HjpXUTMec" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n\r\n<b>Mechanics.</b> Blog content shouldn’t be created then published to the web without thinking through the structure. Is the structure optimized for Google? Is it SEO friendly? Is it user-friendly? The content structure will benefit the blog by increasing its value to Google, thus ranking the blog post higher and higher in the search rankings. Pillar posts, specific categories, and interlinking content is a simple strategy to conquering these mechanics.\r\n\r\n<b>Distribution.</b> Blog content is only as effective as its distribution plan. Does your startup blog have a distribution plan? Distribution is the queen to the king of content. By distributing content consistently and frequently, the process grows the reach of a blog. Also by amplifying your content through a simple repurpose strategy, you can use the same content across different channels. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/repurpose-content/"><strong>READ ALSO: How to Repurpose Content</strong></a>\r\n<h2>Follow Suit: The Best SaaS Company Blogs</h2>\r\nNo need to reinvent the wheel. Several SaaS startups are \'winning\' when it comes to producing a quality and a lead-generating blog. Here are three blogs at the top of our list:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/working-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HelpScout Blog:</a> The blog is well structured with specific categories tailored to audience challenges and pains. It’s also easy to read.</li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-abcs-of-video-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moz Blog:</a> Moz is considered an industry leader in digital marketing. Things we like: well-structured and video content within the blog posts.</li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk Blog:</a> Zendesk blog is by far the coolest with engaging blog graphics to keep the reader on the page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Build a B2B blog</h2>\r\nAre you thinking to start a blog for your startup? As mentioned, a blog is a strong ally and strategy for channeling quality prospects towards your service. It builds authority and transparency with the target audience while generating a strong return in organic traffic numbers. <strong>Starting a blog</strong> should be a priority in a startup’s marketing strategy — <strong>Have you started one?</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

I made it. I made it to six months running my content marketing agency full-time. When someone decides to become a business owner and entrepreneur, I don’t think it fully resonates in their head how freakin’ hard it\'s going to be. For me, it was just like this. I was always one for starting new projects, and I had freelanced on and off over the last 6 years.\r\n\r\nThen, I told myself:\r\n<blockquote>Megan, you can do this full-time.</blockquote>\r\nI thought, "what the heck, if not now, when?” And so I dived deep into the world of owning my own business.\r\n\r\n<strong>AND I LOVE IT. It’s empowering. It’s exciting.</strong>\r\n\r\nI meet amazing people that support me — and I support them.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not an absence of hard work, tears, anger, confusion, and doubt.\r\n\r\nI’ve always loved the word: “resilient.” But that word hasn’t meant so much to me until these last six months. As a business owner, you have to be resilient. You ride the good times. You prepare for the bad. You cry a little, then it all gets better. One day you’re positive, and the next you’re a little negative. But you keep pushing, you keep trying, and you become resilient.\r\n\r\nI’ve become more resilient in the last six months. I’ve had weeks with no clients. I’ve sent the wrong email. I’ve written crappy cold emails. I’ve done a little bit of it all, but it’s resilience that pushed me through — and how I learn along the way.\r\n\r\nToday, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganthudium/">LinkedIn,</a> is my sixth month as a founder of my content marketing agency.\r\n\r\nAs an insightful and reflective person, I feel the urge to gather my thoughts and present six insights I’ve learned over the last few months.\r\n<h2>Six thoughts at six months of being a business owner</h2>\r\n<strong>No shame in a relaxed day.</strong>\r\n\r\nAs a business owner, I would often feel guilty if I’m not busy 24/7 and working towards my goals in my business. I quickly forget about the power of relaxation and how relaxation benefits your long-term health as a business owner. There is no shame in taking a relaxing day in my book. If you want to take a Friday to enjoy summer or check out early to have a coffee with a friend — these are important to personal well being. And a happy founder equals a happy business.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thank those around you, immensely.</strong>\r\n\r\nHave you paused to think how often those around you <em>give</em> to keep you, your business and your sanity in check? I’ve had friends to brainstorm ideas with, partners to comfort me, and parents to pick me back up when I fall. I’m incredibly fortunate, and I know this, but it brings a valid point. It takes a VILLAGE to run a business successfully.\r\n\r\n<strong>It takes time.</strong>\r\n\r\nI count myself fortunate in the last six months growing my business. I’ve had several clients, and I’ve only had one that didn’t pay me (on time). Growing a business simply takes time. If I look around at other marketing agencies that I consider successful, they’re already approaching the four, five, and six years in the business. Growing a business takes time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Search for your rhythm.</strong>\r\n\r\nFinding my rhythm. Finding my productivity, schedule, and a weekly plan was a challenge for my first six months. Oh, I had a to-do list. I had Asana, but it wasn’t until this last month that I started to feel like everything was in control.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stay positive — remind yourself constantly that you can do this.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf I had a dollar for every time...[...]...I would be a rich person. Doubt and negative thoughts are the number one defeater of a small business owner. Often, I’ve let negative thoughts and words enter my brain telling me, “I’m not good enough” “Your success is based on the number of clients you book.” “What are you doing?” Staying positive is a challenge and a necessity for success.\r\n\r\n<strong>Be inspired by those around you succeeding — and don’t settle for jealousy.</strong>\r\n\r\nJealousy. That creeping stomach feeling that comes into the picture when your confidence is low. Jealousy creeps in when I’m at my lowest, and when I’m not positive. I start the comparison game. I see others succeed, and instead of celebrating their accomplishments, I get jealous. I think this is human, but I’ve taught myself over the last six months to reverse think and play the ‘inspiration’ mind game. Be proud of their success. Use it as motivation to achieve my success. Be inspired to continue forward.\r\n<h2>Six learning for my six months as a business owner.</h2>\r\nI will continue to reflect on these and take everyone to heart. These are many learnings, and at this point in the journey, I’m learning to celebrate how far I’ve already come and inspired myself to continue.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="single solid" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

The planner is a step-by-step strategy workbook, informative guide and tool - coupled with monthly and weekly calendar spreads. If you are a startup, solopreneur or digital content creator, the DigiCo is your complete guide to conquering, organizing and being found online effectively.\r\n\r\nThis blog post is a step-by-step guide to printing the DigiCo on Dox Zoo. Dox Zoo is an online printing platform that ships the DigiCo planner globally. I personally printed a content planner for myself from Dox Zoo, and I was impressed with the quality.\r\n<h2>How to Print the DigiCo</h2>\r\nVisit the <a href="https://doxzoo.com/">DOX ZOO main website page.</a> On the homepage, you’ll mouse click “Upload Your File.” On the “choose a file” upload screen, select the button “Upload from my computer.” The DigiCo arrived to you in two formats: A4 and US Letter. Depending on your location, you will want to upload the relevant file. Upload the file that says:\r\n\r\n<b>Content Planner_USA Letter_Print.pdf</b>\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n<b>Content Planner_A4_Print.pdf</b>\r\n\r\nThese two files have been saved and formatted specifically to be printed on Dox Zoo. After arriving to this page, you will select <strong>continue. </strong>You have many options to print the Digital Content Printer. I printed the planner as “<strong>Wire Binding”</strong>, which was perfect for everyday use. After selecting “Wire Binding”, you now begin to format the planner. I walk you step-by-step in the below video on who to select the correct settings for printing. I will also explain the process in detail.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/3FwZOYVupZY" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n<h2>Step-by-Step Print Guidelines</h2>\r\nDocument Settings: The document should be formatted to <strong>80 PAGES, PORTRAIT, DOUBLE SIDED and COLOUR</strong>. You do have the option to print the planner in black &amp; white and not colour. The total price will significantly drop.\r\n\r\nPage Range: Many of these settings are already set, but paper colour is <strong>WHITE</strong>, paper finish is <strong>MATTE</strong> and paper weight is 120 <strong>GSM</strong>. I suggest to use the paper at a thicker weight, because the lowest is very light.\r\n\r\nBinding: To bind the planner, the binding position is on <strong>LEFT-LONG-EDGE</strong> and the wire colour is <strong>SILVER.</strong>\r\n\r\nCover: The cover has a clear “Clear acetate” on the front and back to protect it. Select “configure cover”:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Outer Front Cover --- CLEAR ACETATE</li>\r\n \t<li>Front Cover --- NONE</li>\r\n \t<li>Back Cover --- NONE</li>\r\n \t<li>Outer Back Cover --- CLEAR ACETATE</li>\r\n \t<li>Cover preview --- CONFIRM</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNumber of Copies: Select <strong>ONE</strong> and “Go to Basket”.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you\'ve finished the process to print the DigiCo. If you have problems regarding the printing of the DigiCo, I’m reachable by <a href="mailto: megan@mtcthecontentagency.com">email</a> for questions. Please note that I can’t be held reliable on printing quality standards and the final print product of the DigiCo by Dox Zoo. I have only printed from them myself, and I recommend the printing quality. I can’t be held reliable for the print job by Doc Zoo, and the printing isn’t included in the final price of $25 USD.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Since moving to Berlin, Germany in 2017, I have come to terms with the word “empathy.” Granted. I did hear the word when I lived in California - but the word did not ‘click’.\r\n\r\n<img class="size-full wp-image-2450 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-post-empathy_Blog-Picture.jpg" alt="" width="3751" height="2501" />\r\n\r\nBut empathy is on a new playing field for me in Germany. I am now on the other side of the field. I am no longer the one looking to [just] give empathy, but I am the one searching for it, constantly.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because moving to a new country, starting a business and connecting with a new community is hard. On top of it, I have to do it in another language with the bureaucracy of the German government. Yes, it can be trying at times. But I have learned so much in the process.\r\n\r\nI now understand empathy on an entirely new level. I might go as far as to say that it now has added meaning - and it has lead me to approach empathy more strongly in my marketing.\r\n\r\nMy short story is to show the importance of empathy - and how we should incorporate it into our marketing. Because empathy is a daily player and an important ally for marketers to harness. Content empathy marketing is the future of marketing. It will define the edge to our marketing departments and allow us to better connect with the ideal audience, help them, and influence them toward a purchase.\r\n\r\nAnd b2b empathy marketing can even be seen as more complex and icky. In a field that is traditionally pegged with words like “dry” and “straight-forward”, empathy marketing is a great asset to connect with b2b prospects on a much deeper and meaningful level.\r\n<h2>What is empathy marketing?</h2>\r\nI will lay out the <b>empathy marketing definition</b> plan and simple.\r\n<blockquote>To summarize, <a href="https://kapost.com/b/b2b-empathy-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">empathy</a> is “the capacity to understand what another person is experiencing from within the other person’s frame of reference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in another’s shoes.”</blockquote>\r\nEmpathy translates to marketing empathy by means of the process. As marketers, we design complex and intuitive marketing campaigns to hone in on unique audience emotions at every level of the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience buyer’s journey</a>.\r\n\r\nOur deeper understanding of the emotions on each level channels our empathetic-thinking and encourages us to create purposeful content marketing campaigns that target the ideal audience, connects with them, builds trust, and helps them specifically at each stage of the journey.\r\n\r\nScience <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/win-customers-with-empathy-marketing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> connecting human experience with emotion leads to better and deeper connections. Emotional connection is the ultimate goal of empathy marketing to establish a firm bridge between emotion, the messaging, the solution, and the brand.\r\n<h2>Why empathy marketing is important</h2>\r\nThe importance of marketing empathy is looked at from two angles. On the business perspective, empathy allows the marketer to create content that is strongly tailored to the needs, challenges and pains of the target audience and buyer persona, enabling marketers to create highly effective marketing campaigns that produce strong ROIs and influence.\r\n\r\nI personally believe empathy marketing is important for human connection. The days of sleazy car salesman tactics are falling to the sidelines, and the buyer’s market is becoming more and more educated, skillful, and in search of a unique experience.\r\n\r\nIn order to remain progressive and in front of this trend, marketers need to start approaching content empathetically to build stronger connections and trust with the audience. Empathy will play a large part in personalization and creating unique-tailored experiences for customers.\r\n<h2>How to bridge empathy with content marketing</h2>\r\nThe process of being empathetic in content marketing is not hard. These are a few quick steps a marketer or content creator can take to start navigating towards empathetic content.\r\n\r\n<b>Take the Time to Befriend Your Audience</b>\r\n\r\nIt starts with understanding<strong> all</strong> your buyer personas and customer journeys. But it goes much deeper than that. It also involves asking the right questions in such a way that allows customers to openly talk about their journey and story.\r\n\r\nIt is also about them. Frankly, marketers do not take the time to talk to actual customers. Befriending the audience is treating them like a real human being. Meaning, the marketer and team is scheduling occasional interviews with current customers, attending events, and speaking to potential customers to better understand them.\r\n\r\n<b>Humanize the content</b>\r\n\r\nKnow your audience and speak directly to them. Depending on b2b or b2c or the industry, change your startup <a href="https://www.copypress.com/blog/how-empathy-is-key-to-great-marketing/">voice</a> to match the language the audience is speaking. Changing the voice is not only for content on the website and blog - but it also involves the content on individual social media channels and emails.\r\n\r\nDo they like approachable? Do they like sophisticated? Do like simple, plain and dry? How would you talk to them, if the content was being spoken in person? We have to remember that digital content is an extension of the conversation done offline, thus we should treat it just as human.\r\n<h2>A quick example of empathy marketing in action</h2>\r\nThe Field Trip to Mars created by Lockheed Martin is a prime example of a b2b company revolutionizing the education technology industry to make meaningful experiences for students. I believe it shows how business to business companies can target a specific need and emotion in the education technology field and work together to bring empathy to the learning process.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_bSOwFWu-A&amp;feature=youtu.be" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n\r\nIn this example, Elan Languages elegantly puts it into perspective just how the end-user experience can be tainted by crappy copy translation.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9sD-5tOx9A&amp;feature=youtu.be " alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n<h2>Empathy should guide your content marketing.</h2>\r\nWhat is the next step in content marketing? Empathy or the ability to understand another person’s experience from within the other person’s frame of reference. Empathy marketing in b2b bridges strong audience connections and meaningful, lasting relationships. It is not only important, but it is also easy to introduce. It is simply a change of mindset, and it begins by switching from solution-first to problem-first human-centered marketing.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

I mean, like really got to know them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Befriending your audience isn’t as simple as sending out a nice survey and hoping for an answer. I agree that the online survey is a good start, but you need to jump through multiple hoops to gather enough intelligence on your audience for smart content creation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The process involves <strong>active listening.</strong></span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is active listening?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/active-listening-skills-with-examples-2059684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active listening</a> is the ability to redirect your focus from what is going on inside your head to the needs of your prospective interviewee. It’s all about them. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/ideal-audience/"><strong>Read: The Key to Identify and Befriend Your Ideal Audience</strong></a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">When conducting human-centered interviews, you have to actively listen. The benefit is on both sides of the table. On one side, you’re able to comprehend and build a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of the audience. If you’re able to see to their level, content creation actively becomes more focused and purposeful. On the other hand, your audience knows if you’re not ‘in it to win it.’ Interviewing is tedious and hard work for both sides. Active listening helps ensure the time is well spent — and the audience remains engaged.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Active listening benefits the interview process, but how can we take a step further with our empathy interviews?</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to conduct empathy interviews</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Preparation for the <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/techniques-of-empathy-interviews-in-design-thinking--cms-31219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviews</a> is only the beginning. Once the interview process begins, it becomes more important to remain human-centric in the way interviews are conducted. Here are a few suggestions.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Create a friendly atmosphere.</b> Often times, I see customer interviews in cold and unfriendly office spaces. There is no reason <em>not</em> to take a current customer out to lunch or coffee to conduct an interview. As long as the space is quiet, a more friendly and relaxed atmosphere helps the interview run smoother.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Introduce yourself, then make it all about them.</strong> The interview needs context. What is the project? Why are you there? Answer the basics, then immediately turn the attention to the interviewee, because the interview is about them. How often have you been in an interview where the interviewer [Mark and Marge] dominated the conversation?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>When in doubt, ask why.</strong> ‘Why’ is the magic statement for human-centered interview questions. By continuously asking why, you dig deeper and deeper into the meaning, emotions, motivations, and thinking process that leads the interviewee to come to a conclusion on their thoughts.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Human-centered interview questions</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I personally believe the interview question list is never set in stone. It’s continuously evolving and improving. It’s becoming more and more human-centered as you learn how to ask better questions and ask in such a way that your audience spills the secrets. Now, I’m spilling my secrets. <strong>Below are eight interview questions I ask my audience frequently.</strong> Why frequently? Because the intelligence gathering process never ends. You need to continue to gather and befriend your audience in order to keep fulfilling their needs — and help them achieve their goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Here are my favorite interview questions to ask your audience.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What keywords and search phrases do they use when searching for [topic] solution?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">When it comes to [topic], what keeps you up at night thinking about it?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What is the biggest inhibitor in your business from reaching your goals?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What is your biggest hairball?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What do you obsessed about on a daily basis - and that never seems to get better?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What is the biggest challenge you’re facing right now in the area of ….?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What are the roadblocks you’re having right now in growing your business?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Why are you losing business opportunities?</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">Start with these human-centered interview questions</span></strong></span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Human-centered interview questions are fundamental components of human-centered digital content. I would even argue that it’s the most important component. Human-geared interview questions help you navigate to the heart and soul of your content. The process involves active listening, conducting empathy interviews, and asking the right questions of your audience.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

There are no magic potions or magic formulas. Creating a B2B content strategy that drives results takes industry expertise, audience understanding, and strategic implementation. It includes a strategic process to create better and more valuable content for an audience. Your content will help your audience reach their goals, and in return, you will reach the target numbers you wish.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Yes, you need a strategy.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As an agency, we often see clients deep-dive into content creation without a strategy. Our world is driven by output, but as we tell our clients, your content will produce minimal results if you don\'t put the time and strategic effort into a documented B2B content marketing strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The strategy will provide you with a specified worldview that is identical to your ideal customer\'s view. By starting with strategy, you are ensuring that you\'ve identified the ideal audience, ideal content assets, and the strategic direction that needs to be taken. I can\'t emphasize this enough. You need a document B2B content strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A documented content strategy will help you reach your goals. The online world is changing. Content is catching on, and it’s growing exponentially. It’s more difficult now than it has ever been before to rank your content, to get it noticed, and to have more eyeballs engaging with your content. It\'s just harder. And it\'s next to impossible without a strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If you don’t have a strategy, you risk falling into the dark reaches of the internet where your content will never reach the humans that you ask of it to attract.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In this comprehensive article, you will be introduced to the B2B content marketing strategy. You will learn what B2B content is, why it is important, and why you need a documented content strategy. And lastly, you will learn how to start with B2B content strategy—how to get started, move in the right direction, and start seeing results with your content.\r\n</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is B2B content marketing?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content marketing is a collection of content pieces (i.e. blog posts, downloads, Instagram pieces, and more) that are created to educate your customer about your products, services, or a content topic by the means of quality, relevant, and helpful information.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3457" src="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/quote_Resource-banner.png" alt="Introduction to B2B content marketing strategy" width="886" height="331" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content is a broad term, and it encompasses a variety of different approaches and content types. For example, content can be developing a webinar series, or it can involve creating valuable content on Instagram. It\'s two different content mediums, but both have to do with content marketing. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For B2B companies, our agency recommends that you start with editorial content on your website, white papers, eBooks, LinkedIn content, and email content. It\'s a combination of both content and inbound marketing tactics that will help you reach your lead and traffic goals. B2B content marketing is different than other types of industry marketing because it\'s created to attract B2B audiences that require high-level educational content, nurturing, and continuous information for a long period. This makes the strategic planning and content creation process for B2B industries more complex. Finally, there are specific channels that work best for B2B content marketing, and these include LinkedIn content, webinars, Google organic search, and relationship building efforts.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Your strategy helps you decide what content to produce. It starts with strategy (and planning) and digital talking to your ideal reader with the right information, in the right format, and at the right time to attract a well-defined target market (and retain them.)

Here is a brief outlook on the current buyer’s landscape:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Readers are more educated and engaged in the buying process than ever before, and they demand relevant and useful information to inform their buying decisions.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content is the element that helps individuals make informed decisions, and they’re demanding for it. The amount of content consumed before reaching a buying decision depends on the industry—but here’s a statistic that gives us insight into the value of using content as a pre-sale education tool in the B2B field.</span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><em> 47% of B2B buyers read 3-5 blog posts or content pieces before talking with a salesperson (Source: <a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="http://www.demandgenreport.com/resources/research/2016-content-preferences-survey-b2b-buyers-value-content-that-offers-data-and-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DemandGenReport</a>)</em></span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content is popular, but here are a few more supporting reasons on why B2B content marketing is important.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content builds trust with your audience.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content builds authority online.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">SEO loves content.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content supports your paid marketing.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Content nurtures your audience and advances the sales cycle.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Do you agree? We should strive to produce quality content because it boosts your <em>authentic </em>online presence. Content is important, because it’s a major player in the online world today. It builds relationships with your audience, and it’s a strong framework for generating online traffic.

With each topic, you\'re provided with additional content from our content marketing blog to help you understand the concept further.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to define the buyer persona</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Know your audience. To create quality and purposeful content, you need to understand your buyer persona (or audience) as a best friend. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">If you think of your best friend, you know what keeps them up at night, what their everyday struggles &amp; challenges are, and how they think and search out answers. This is the state of mind that you must develop for your business audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">The buyer persona is a representation of your ideal customer. It provides an overview of who that person is, their demographics, what they like (and dislike), their motivates, emotions, and habits. It becomes very, very detailed.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">To become very detailed with your buyer persona you will need to (1) talk to your ideal customer in person, and (2) always be updating your ideal buyer persona profile.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Many companies will draw out the buyer persona on a piece of paper, in Trello, or another similar application. This is great because it allows the whole team to see and understand who they are talking to.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">How do you paint a picture of your ideal audience? How can you understand them and know them better? It’s done by asking. To complete this exercise and define the target persona, you will need to do a thorough intelligence gathering.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You’ll start by gathering demographic information on the target persona by looking at analytical tools like Google Analytics. Start with these <a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/03/21/how-to-identify-and-speak-to-your-customer-personas/#33fc94154c4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questions </a>to create a framework. </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What is their gender?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What is their education background?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What is their location?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">How do they get their news?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What social media platforms are they on?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What are their values?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What challenges do they face in their career or personal life?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">What are their pain points (i.e. what keeps them up at night worrying)?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once you’ve gathered what you can from Google Analytics, I suggest sending out an audience survey using a tool like Typeform. The key here is making sure your online survey is short, concise, and easy to navigate. It\'s most successful when the survey questions are shorter, fewer, and written in the language of the target persona.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you’ve gathered intelligence from Google Analytics and the survey, the next step is meeting this person live. Take your ideal audience persona out for coffee and ask them a few of these questions. Make the meeting relaxed and meaningful with open-ended questions that allow your audience persona to just talk away.

Many marketers become hyper-focused in producing content, generating topic ideas, and finalizing content—<strong>they forget to repurpose and distribute the content.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It\'s an important step that shouldn\'t be forgotten.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">As a general rule, you should plan to distribute your new piece of content at least <strong>five times over the three months afters its publication</strong>. This will allow for the content to be shown to new audiences—and as we know, it takes over five times of consistent marketing messaging for a new idea to stick with a customer.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You can distribute content through the social media channels that you have chosen. However, you can also choose to distribute the content through your email newsletter, employee/advocate social channels, and third-party website distribution platforms. In a recent article, we highlight several valuable distribution channels for the B2B industry.

Humans don’t care about your product or service. They care about their own problems much more than they care about your company. It\'s time to reverse direction and think towards a more human-centered approach to your digital marketing. Because of this reality, content is crucial. All types of human-centered marketing content — blog content, video content, community content, forums, and social media content — are relevant to staying competitive in the B2B industry.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content is a method to connect with humans — and help them better understand their challenges and to problem-solve to a solution.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It\'s important to practice human-centered marketing. It\'s mandatory to remain competitive in 2020 and beyond. Because of COVID-19, customers now demand a more human-centered and empathetic relationship with their vendors. The virus has accelerated the need for empathetic, human-centered, and relevant marketing. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">According to Janrain,<a href="http://janrain.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/online-consumers-fed-up-with-irrelevant-content-on-favorite-websites-according-to-janrain-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 74% of consumers are frustrated</a> when a website’s content holds no interest for them. Give your audience relevant marketing and quality content that is created <strong>for them. </strong>To do this, you will need to clearly define your audience, practice empathetic marketing approaches, and ask the right questions.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is human-centered marketing?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><em>“Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem-solving […] It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs.” —<a href="http://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IDEO</a></em></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The human-centered theory is usually tied to user-experience and working through design challenges for mobile applications, websites, and services. But it doesn\'t have to be all about UX. It can (and should) also be formally applied to digital marketing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Traditionally, marketers approach their marketing product-first. The B2B company has a product (or service) with a considerable amount of features that they consider is the best on the market. The value proposition is based on the product and the company (and not on the customer). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The human-first marketing approach is must more empathetic. It takes a better understanding and empathetic knowledge of the customer to identify the core motivations, challenges, concerns, feelings, and struggles their experiencing to provide effective digital marketing. The company messaging can then be molded around these core finding — leaving a much more effective means of engaging a customer.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why is empathy a major piece?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Empathy is at the core of human-centered marketing content. In order to stay competitive in the digital world, we need to create marketing content that is intertwined with human understanding.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: optima;">This begins with empathy.</span></strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Empathy is understanding the audience at their level — can you relate to them? Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To get to this point, marketers have to have conversation with their customers. As simple as it sounds, this is a common mistake that many marketers make. They remain out-of-touch with their audience. They don\'t speak to the sales team regularly. Their digital marketing tactics are out-of-touch with their audience. This leaves their strategic tactics stuck. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">To remain empathetic, marketers must practice active listening. Get in touch with your audience where they traditionally hang out online. You can try these empathetic tactics;\r\n</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Schedule quarterly in-person customer meetings</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Attend a trade show with the sales team</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Engage in digital forums (or conversational rooms)</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Create conversational marketing through social media</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">This human and real approach to online interaction must translate over into the content creation process. And this process begins with stepping into an ‘empathetic mindset’ — and being real about knowing the audience and caring about their challenges. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Tony Zambito, a considered marketing expert in this area, explains this as three phases’ marketers and organizations journey through. He calls this framework: <a href="http://tonyzambito.com/3-phases-human-centered-marketing-customers-h-u-m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Centered Marketing –  H.U.M.</a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-empathy-marketing/"><strong>Read more: B2B empathy marketing</strong></a></span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">How to ask the right questions</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In order to better understand your customers, you must ask the right questions. And these questions should be open but also in the right conversational context. If you do this, you will remain close to your audience and able to generate more effective marketing strategies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">For example during in-person interviews, to ask the right questions of your audience: <a href="https://medium.com/user-research/never-ask-what-they-want-3-better-questions-to-ask-in-user-interviews-aeddd2a2101e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never ask your audience what they want</a>. It automatically places their thinking into a boxed mindset. And it automatically encourages them to navigate to a solution-first approach mindset, where they have thought of a possible solution to their problem without fully understanding the problem or dissecting it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Here are a few examples of possible questions to ask;</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What are you trying to get done currently in your business? What are your goals?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What content workflow do you provide to your website visitors?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What is frustrating you about your current content creation process?</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Asking the right questions help you get to the root of customer challenges and problems. But also continuing to ask the question: ‘why’ . Why allows you to dig deeper into the context and gather more information on your audience. Human-centered content is deeply rooted in asking the right questions of your audience. </span>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/human-centered-interview-questions/"><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Read more: Human-centered interview questions</span></strong></a>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Great examples of human-centered marketing</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The core concept of human-centered marketing is empathy and human understanding. And human understanding begins with asking the right questions and investigating target audience pain points, challenges, and emotions. </span><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Once you have a clear understanding of these components, your marketing tactics become much more <a href="https://www.grbj.com/blogs/6-marketing-pr-advertising/post/90863-is-your-content-strategy-human-centered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human-centric</a>. You position yourself as a problem-solver, providing tangible solutions to your audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>There are a few businesses that understand the human-centered approach to marketing. They\'ve created marketing campaigns and content situated empathetically towards their customer.\r\n</strong></span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a> does a fantastic job speaking the language of their target audience. The language is simple, unique and quirky, which is human-centered. Basecamp’s copy and content focus on everyday business project management problems - and builds a conversation around those topics to engage and entertain the online audience.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://blogs.workday.com/three-easy-steps-to-more-impressive-board-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workday</a> has also taken the time to understand their ideal audience. They span the entire human-centered scope and target topics of their audience that are not directly related to their product or solution. Instead, they write about topics like “Three Easy Steps to More Impressive Board Reports”, which is a challenge of the target audience and is not solution-based.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Make sure your content marketing strategy is human-centered</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Human-centered digital content is the next evolution of strategic digital marketing. Humans care about their own challenges and emotions. As B2B marketers, we must navigate the complex thoughts of our ideal audience to uncover authentic and useful digital marketing approaches that benefit our audience. To make more attract more relevant customers (and retain them longer), the human-centered approach will help B2B companies get at that point.\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Our content is meant to educate, entertain, grow, and influence. Sounds great - right? Content should be created for the reader - human-centric and purposeful.\r\n\r\nIn the human-centric content mindset development process, the first step is to create a buyer persona and audience journey workflow. The second step is to complete the <b>first content bundle</b>, which includes three important content pieces fundamental to online business.\r\n\r\nA <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/buyer-persona/">buyer persona</a> and <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/audience-journey/">audience journey</a> are pivotal to content healthiness. Understanding these two elements place content in perspective - by first understanding the audience and creating content around the audience purposefully for them.\r\n\r\nAfter the buyer persona, audience journey, and content calendar are complete, there are three important content elements to undertake next in the content creation process.\r\n<h2>What are your content goals?</h2>\r\nI will take a wild guess and say - you wish to increase website visits, email subscriptions, and/or product/service buyers. These are common goals for online content creators. A <b>conversion element</b> to begin the content funnel is central to meeting all these goals.\r\n\r\nAs a content creator, you already have a content calendar set. You are producing enriching and quality content for your audience. Your page views might even be going up based on my buyer persona and audience journey teachings. Blog content is a major organic traffic driver, and as it attracts new audience numbers, you want to capture the information of those that are <b>most </b>relevant to your business.\r\n\r\nThe next step in online content strategy is to create <b>three important content pieces in content bundle</b>. What are they?\r\n<h2>Content ebook or Beginner’s Guide</h2>\r\nOnline blog content grows a following and lures potential clients. Content is performing exactly how you wanted, and it is bringing new clients your way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of every blog article, the piece needs a conversion element. Usually, these types of pieces are white papers, beginner’s guides, or ebooks targeting the ideal audience with a rather broad subject line.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to educate and inform - providing value and a continuous narrative. A long-form content piece like an ebook, guide, or white paper is the first must have in your content arsenal. Interested website visitors exchange their email for valuable content to reach their personal goals. Once you have an email, you begin determining if the individual is a potential client or not.\r\n<h2>Enticing Landing Page Copy</h2>\r\nThe second content piece is enticing landing page copy. I am not an expert copywriter - but I know the <b>value</b> of strong copy conversion. Strong copy pulls the reader in, entices them, entertains them, and encourages them to one action (and one alone).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the action is a download in the form of a long-form content piece. Engaging copy convinces the reader of the content’s value.\r\n<h2>Warm Welcome Email Copy</h2>\r\nThe last element is a regularly forgotten content piece in the <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-funnel/">content funnel</a>. You have enticed the reader to download a long-form content piece. Now, welcome them warmly and with open arms.\r\n\r\nAfter download, the first email to them should be a warm introduction from you, the brand or company. Who are you? What are you all about? How are you going to help this person? Put a little bit of story behind it. Let them know in a warm welcome email copy.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nThe content funnel is an excellent resource for your online business to nurture and engage with potential customers.\r\n\r\nBut the content funnel does not include random pieces of miscellaneous content. It is strategic with content that moves potential clients through the buying journey.\r\n\r\nAn ebook, enticing landing page copy, and a warm welcome email are three important content elements to build out the content funnel and drive its success.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

If so, the first order of business when you arrive in a new city is to find a map. Most likely, the traveler’s map came from the local tourist office. I love those maps because they tell you everything you need to know about a new city. It highlights the top attractions, the best bus routes, and it even gives recommendations for restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe staff at the tourist office took the time to understand their target audience. They understand the needs and wants of that person throughout their travel day — and the map highlights their journey from one point to the next.\r\n\r\n<em>A buyer’s journey map is not much different.</em> It tells a story. It\'s the story of a business’s main customer and the roadblocks and detours they take to successfully reach a goal. The term takes on many forms. Frequently, the term is written as ‘buyer’s journey’, or ‘customer journey’, and the process is often called customer journey mapping. I refer to it often as ‘audience journey’, because I work with a wide range of clients that don\'t always have customers.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the unique journey is ideal for crafting content and copy to their needs. By taking the time to research, understand and map the journey — a business can better target and attract the best possible customer and successfully guide them towards a purchase.\r\n<h2>What is the buyer’s journey?</h2>\r\nAs described in the analogy, a buyer’s journey is literally a mapped out journey. The map highlights visually a path for a buyer persona to walk from pain point/challenge to purchase decision. Have you created a buyer persona?<a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/buyer-persona/"><strong> Read about it and create one.</strong></a>\r\n\r\nCustomer journey mapping is a way to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/11/26/what-is-customer-journey-mapping-and-why-is-it-important/#560e27105a76" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visualize</a> the buyer persona’s experience and how they interact with the business or website. It acts as an interactive overview to help team members and yourself see how the ideal audience member moves through the process and makes decisions.\r\n\r\nThe map is comprised of four steps: <em>awareness, consideration, purchase, and advocacy</em>. I follow Hubspot\'s terminology and description. You can learn more about the journey steps in this video.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPu57KQrKFk&amp;feature=youtu.be" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n\r\nWith the help of a journey map, you become more specific about the experience your audience experiences. It gives you a sense of unique challenges and pain points at each <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step of the journey</a>. What is the best way to acquire this information? I call this process intelligence gathering and the best way to do so is to <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/human-centered-interview-questions/">talk to humans</a>.\r\n<h2>How mapping improves content creation</h2>\r\nAs a business, you read this blog post and say, “I already have everything defined. I understand my customer.” My next question would be: Do you <i>really </i>have everything defined? Can you talk about your customer’s journey like was a friend\'s?\r\n\r\nI often see businesses understand basic demographics and one or two customer pain points. I don\'t undervalue this contribution, but it\'s important to realize that it\'s just the beginning. A journey map reflects the breakdown of<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> individual journey phases</a>, each with a goal, individual touch points, and challenges for that customer’s moment.\r\n\r\n<em>It\'s much more complex — and it takes longer than one workshop afternoon. It\'s in constant flux and improvement.</em>\r\n\r\nA journey map supports a content marketing strategy in a variety of ways. First, it adds clarity to the work process. For <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/11/26/what-is-customer-journey-mapping-and-why-is-it-important/#560e27105a76" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX or backend designers</a>, the journey map provides context to the user experience. It helps identify missing navigation connections, stress points, and customer frustrations. For content managers, it defines key content pieces that naturally engage and contribute to the buying process. By defining pain points and challenges, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content writers</a> develop content that doesn\'t turn the audience away.\r\n\r\nNot defining the buyer persona and journey is dangerous. It\'s a waste of time and resources to begin content creation without defining these two key steps. If you begin without, you risk writing content that is too broad for the audience, and for people who may never be interested in your product or service. It\'s best to target the audience that helps achieve your goals.\r\n\r\n<em>How will a journey map help me?</em> It\'s a visual aid. It\'s part of the core understanding of a business and why you do what you do. Teams become visual by using sticky notes and whiteboards to map it out; others use excel sheets. Creativity is important, but even more important, the startup should have the journey visually mapped on paper.\r\n<h2>How to create a customer journey mapping template</h2>\r\nA journey map is important. By now, you know what it is and why a business should take the time to create one. The journey map visually shows the process from an organic online stranger to a customer...and to a loyal fan. A customer journey map deviates into four phases: awareness, consideration, purchase and advocate. Each phase of the journey map highlights key sections. These sections include important information:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Narrative: What is the narrative for the specific journey phase?</li>\r\n \t<li>Goals &amp; Objectives: List the goals and objectives of that buyer persona.</li>\r\n \t<li>Pain Points &amp; Challenges: List the audience pain points and challenges for the specific journey phase.</li>\r\n \t<li>Typical Questions: What do they ask?</li>\r\n \t<li>Audience Emotions: What are they feeling?</li>\r\n \t<li>Interactions: List potential touch points (or areas the persona interacts online (or sometimes offline)).</li>\r\n \t<li>Best Forms of Content: No content is created equal - what is the best piece for the journey level?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nView additional <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/meganthudium/what-is-customer-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completed journey maps and visuals</a> — and use this basic chart to start mapping your own.\r\n<h2 style="text-align: center;">“X, Y &amp; Z” Journey Map</h2>\r\n[fusion_table fusion_table_type="1" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]\r\n<div class="table-1">\r\n<table width="100%">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th align="left"></th>\r\n<th align="left">Awareness</th>\r\n<th align="left">Consideration</th>\r\n<th align="left">Purchase</th>\r\n<th align="left">Advocacy</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="left"><strong>Narrative</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Pain Points &amp; Challenges</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Typical Questions</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Audience Emotions</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Interactions</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Types of Content</strong></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n[/fusion_table]\r\n\r\nThe process of developing a customer journey map puts you in tune with the ideal audience. It has you thinking for them and creating content for them. Defining the journey is important for content creation. It aids you in mapping out appropriate content for your customer. It helps avoid useless and meaningless content that doesn\'t help the audience reach end goals and conversions. By understanding the challenges and pain points for each level, a content creator crafts content most suited to the audience for the specific moment in their journey. For example, the awareness phase is best suited for blog content, because you attract a wide range of potential audience members through targeted keywords and topics. What are other content types for awareness?\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Blog content</li>\r\n \t<li>Infographics</li>\r\n \t<li>Beginner guides and ebooks</li>\r\n \t<li>Social media content</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA blog is a major traffic driver for online business, but the reality is, not 100% of those visitors are your ideal audience. The journey map is also key to creating specific content that funnels the correct <em>traffic</em> down the journey. You <em>want </em>unlikely buyers or uninterested readers to jump out of the journey (and not move to the next level) because they\'re not your ideal audience.\r\n\r\nAwareness attracts a large pool of potential visitors, and the consideration phase weeds out the favorite audience members that are likely to buy. What are the ideal content pieces for consideration?\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Testimonials</li>\r\n \t<li>Case studies</li>\r\n \t<li>Product-focused ebooks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAwareness and consideration content is just the beginning of the journey and is often the first tackle of strategy content creation. After the journey map is constructed and the content pieces mapped accordingly, the next step is to create a content funnel. <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-funnel/"><strong>Read more about what a content funnel is and how to create one here.</strong></a>\r\n<h2>Creating an audience journey is important for content marketing.</h2>\r\nUnderstanding the audience journey is fundamental to the content creation process. After a journey map completion, a business is able to target the ideal customer with the appropriate educational content at the time and in the right form. They have a clearer understanding of unique pain points and challenges, and you\'re closer to dance to the rhythm of the customer. The closer you become, you\'re more successful at meeting the goals and expectations of your content marketing strategy. An audience journey puts everything into perspective, and it\'s one of the beginning steps to creating human-centric content marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

You need a content funnel sequence for your startup. If you\'re an online service provider and looking to build an organic content strategy, your strategy must include a content funnel sequence to capture and nurture quality prospects coming your way.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="size-full wp-image-2162 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blog_WhatisaContentFunnel.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" />\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a content funnel?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A content funnel might looks complicated at first glance. It\'s built into four main parts: Attraction, Consideration, Convert and Delight. We follow the </span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HubSpot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inbound methodology in that all areas of the content funnel need to be addressed (i.e. Attract, Engage and Delight) and each part of the content funnel is mapped to the customer journey. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2160 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IM-sales-hub-tools-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" />It\'s fun to create and map the journey of the buyer from first knowing about your brand to the moment they are ready to buy. It\'s like identifying an individual’s story and adopting a storyline to fit their unique situation and to provide them with all the necessary information to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each part of the content funnel has several touchpoints. These touchpoints are areas where you interact with the ideal audience, build awareness, accountability, and acknowledgment until they\'re ready to make the first ‘move’ with your startup. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, in a content funnel, the first move is an ‘action’ on behalf of the website visitor. The marketer gives a ‘Call-to-Action’ that invokes the individual to produce a response. For example, the website visitor makes the move to download a content piece, sign up for a newsletter, or join a social media challenge. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have multiple entry points to the funnel and need a nurturing sequence to accompany every entry point you create. For example, you need a nurturing sequence for the newsletter, an ebook download, or an infographic download entry points on the website.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Let’s choose one, an ebook download, and walk through the process.</strong>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The audience member enters the content funnel via the ebook download landing page. This is the entry point. Now you need a content funnel sequence to walk them through the buying journey from “hey, this is a cool ebook” to “oh, this startup has a solution to my challenge.”</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a content funnel sequence?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to keep a content funnel sequence easy to handle, and I believe having something of quality (over nothing) is better than anything. Capturing audience information and learning more about them is key to the content marketing process. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this in mind, a content funnel sequence is usually as long as it takes to turn a website audience member into a buying customer. The timeframe changes depending on the market, audience, and a B2B or B2C startup.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the time frame is an important nugget of information to get right when building a </span><a href="https://contently.com/2018/12/04/content-marketing-sales-funnel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content funnel sequence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because it gives insight into when to send the first email, how many emails, and at what time bracket. To do this, you need to know your audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For simplicity, I like to begin content funnels as three to four email sequences for a startup. Funnels do not have to be complex. They don\'t have to be tedious. This is what a basic content funnel sequence looks like for an ebook:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 - Introduction Email and ‘Thank you for downloading the ebook’</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 - Did you see these three blog posts about similar topics X,Y, &amp; Z?</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3 - Case Study (or B2C is better with testimonials or reviews)</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 - Sales representative introduction</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Above is a basic 4-step content funnel sequence. In my experience, I built simple three- to four step processes like this one, or I have gone with more lengthy nurturing funnels.</span>\r\n\r\nThese type of funnels are for startups with the challenge of long-buying cycles or selling high-cost assets. Again, it depends on the needs of the audience. Is the product or service a high-cost purchase? If so, it might take the customer longer to make the plunge. Here is an example of this.\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I worked with a solar panel company targeting residential homeowners. The buying process is anywhere from one to six months, and it involves a lot of awareness building and convincing to the benefits of going solar. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the client, I built a 15-step nurturing sequence that started from the very beginning of solar power basics and ended with product reviews and testimonials to test conversion. If they nabbed at the end of the sequence, great, then the candidate moved forward to a personalized call by a team member. If they didn’t, they entered a second nurturing workflow; usually a monthly e-newsletter with similar nurturing content.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content funnel brainstorm</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have covered the basics of a content funnel and a content funnel sequence. Did it give you valuable insight? Now, I want to put words into action and conclude with a short content audit of an education technology website I came across called Klazz.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignleft wp-image-2157 " src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-27-at-11.46.29-300x203.png" alt="Klazz website" width="481" height="278" />\r\n\r\n<a href="https://www.klazz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klazz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a language learning service offering English language learners the opportunity to choose and book an English course experience in London.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My initial impression is they are in the B2C ed-tech market, and they are offering a high-cost service (i.e. in-class English learning). For a student, this offering is a large investment, and it most likely doesn\'t result in impulse buying. Potential students are going to do their research, look at the benefits, compare costs, and in the end, will want to feel taken care of. (Build that trust and authenticity!)</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a review of their online content, I reviewed multiple facets of their website that were ‘spot on’ with the customer journey and content strategy.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klazz has a living and breathing </span><a href="https://www.klazz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It produces quality content that targets basic London travel or English learning needs.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klazz has identified a series of </span><a href="https://www.klazz.com/language-trip-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that potential students ask.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have one (that I can see) content funnel entrance: ‘Get our Free Brochure!’</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Klazz has a quality service, but after review, I didn\'t see them address the top of the funnel with necessary content pieces. They\'re addressing potential students that are already looking to approach an English course abroad.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will put this into a hypothetical mindset. Let say, you are a student who just graduated high school. You took English courses. You want to continue your English-learning options over the summer, but you don\'t know where or how. Or you are a student looking for a gap month trip between high school and university. <strong>How can we encourage these potential customers to become course buyers?</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying ‘top of the funnel’ or awareness-level pain points and challenges are much easier to identify when undergoing the intelligence gathering process with the sales team and current students. If you ask them direct awareness questions, you are likely to develop better insight into the mindset of the potential customer at this buying phase.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this part in the buyer’s journey, I believe Klazz’s approach should be to build awareness and encourage students to dream of the possibility of going abroad. Let’s target English language learners who are currently taking an academic English course. How will I do this?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin, I need a ‘top of the funnel’ piece to capture prospect information. This is your ‘hook’ with the intention to pull them into the nurturing cycle. As it is B2C and a younger audience, I suggest to be creative and ‘speak’ to the buyer persona as closely as possible. Here is a basic approach.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>Sequence #1: Test Your English: Are you an English-speaking rockstar?</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 5-part online quiz testing basic English skills with a mapped character at the conclusion</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Sequence #2: English Pro Challenge: Speak English like a Pro in 3 Steps</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3-part email series with tips and ways to improve English speaking (with videos). Email #3 can be a tip like “how to go abroad to learn from English speaking pros”.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Sequence #3: Introduction to Product (with 10% promotion value)</strong></h3>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In three sequences, you created a basic content funnel with a nurturing approach. The ultimate goal is to attract potential customers to the content funnel through various channels (i.e. social media, email, and PPC), convert them, and have them undergo the nurturing process.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A quality content funnel concept and creation takes audience understanding, market understanding, and just a dusting of creativity. A content funnel is a quality approach to luring a potential audience to the website, building awareness with them, and being in the right place and time for their buying moment. Education technology can benefit greatly from adopting an approach such as this to funnel and attract quality high-cost product buyers.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Many people are in the bandwagon to creating content for their online business, but in most situations, creating content means hashing out hundreds of original articles that barely have an audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">More articles, more people, more companies. Noise. The English arena of the internet is now saturated, and it\'s harder to gain the traction needed to hit traffic and conversion goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\'s more important than ever to define a </span><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your online business before creating content. And even before you start typing away, you need a strategy and a plan of action.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The content strategy process begins with defining the ideal audience. The ideal audience is the perfect readers (or buyers) of the product. They\'re the people with the most need and benefit from having the x,y,z product.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is an ideal audience?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal audience (or a Buyer’s Persona) is a semi-fictional representation of an ideal customer based on market research and real data from existing customers. </span><a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/buyer-persona/"><strong>Read more about what it is and how to create one.</strong></a>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">By defining the ideal audience and creating a buyer persona, the individual creating content is more likely to produce copy that is directly linked to the needs and challenges of the buying customer. Identifying and speaking via content to these individuals builds trust and authority with them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the B2B world, many customers are <strong>not ready to buy</strong> the product at first glance. The product is usually a large investment, and they\'re shopping the internet for the best solution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As content creators, we aim to identify these unique challenges and write about it. If we\'re consistent in our execution, we build authority and trust with these individuals until the </span><b>moment is right for them to buy.</b>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to befriend them?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Befriending the ideal audience is a process I call intelligence gathering. You gather intel on your ideal audience member through various mediums. I talk more in detail about the recommended methods and questions to ask the audience in this webinar.</span>\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/8-HjpXUTMec" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A big mistake I often see, content creators </span><b>never talk to humans.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They create the survey. They research the demographics in marketing industry reports, and they view the statistics on social media dashboards.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these methods are effective  — except for one reason.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk to humans</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">They\'re not talking to human beings. The content we create should be made for humans. It should be useful and personable. It should be human-centric. How can we become more personable?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk to them, identify their challenges, and write content to meet expectations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to humans is the most effective method in the intelligence gathering process. It puts the content creator in check with the rhythm of the customer; thinking like them and creating for them.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you talk to them in person? The process is no different than building a relationship with a best friend. The process is similar, and it should follow suit.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the individual begins interacting with the company on Twitter. You ask questions, give good feedback, and keep the conversation educational. After a conversation is established, ask if they can answer one question about their buying journey. After a few positive interactions, they are more likely to be receptive to this. The question is asked online or through a survey.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a collection of survey answers are collected, invite these people to individual short and to-the-point phone interviews. After the phone interview, ask a select group to come to the office or go out to lunch to become even more personal.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is not a quick thirty days. It\'s a lengthy process and ongoing. You need to be diligent in building a trusting relationship with your audience until they reach the point of wanting to give </span><b>good feedback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and actually, want to make the leap to meet in the person.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remain genuine, you\'ll be surprised how much people are willing to speak, if you\'re willing to listen. Them speaking openly gives you the intel needed to create more authentic and useful content.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

We\'ve all been there, right? The executive circle works with us to align goals and expectations. </span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the end of the day, even if you have all the intentions of reaching those goals and expectations, you seem to fall short. </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: optima;">I\'ve worked with many technology companies that have felt the overwhelm of juggling multiple content expectations, content delivery, lead conversion, and content goals.</span> </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">But the fact is — you\'re not alone. Many content marketing managers are in the same boat. And learning how to repurpose content is a valuable asset to end these pains in your daily workflow and optimize your time.</span>\r\n</span>\r\n<h2>Repurpose content to save time</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I\'m not talking about <em>content spinning</em>. Because you\'re not going to copy &amp; paste the same copy into three different formats. Do not be a spinner. You\'re going to add to those content pieces, exponentially improving them from the primary—adding one more piece every time—and making something great out of it multiple times.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>I call this exponential content.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If you can create content that builds from itself one, two, three or more times, you are going to save yourself a lot of creation time—and you\'re going to deliver content quicker and faster.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">What does this all boil down to?<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Exponential content is simply quality content that is repurposed &amp; reused, said in different ways, and delivered in different formats.</strong> </span></span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content repurposing is a clever way for a content marketer to be smart with content creation.</span></blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima;">Repurpose &amp; reuse quality and performing content topics</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been told this many, many times. Don\'t use the same content on multiple websites or social channels. It\'s a big no, no for SEO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don\'t post the same content again and again. The audience will dislike it. Well, that is an ‘eh, yes and no’.</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">repurpose and reuse</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality content. In some cases, you can republish the same content piece on a content website like Medium.com and not be penalized by Google for doing it. But you shouldn\'t be using the same content again and again on your personal website; instead, you should re-work it, re-word it, and breathe new life into it.</span></span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima;">What are the benefits of repurposing content?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Repurposing content has many benefits. After reading Neil Patel’s content marketing insights, content is at a crossroad. In order to be more competitive, we need to produce better quality and more original content. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google doesn\'t like regurgitated content and unoriginal. I believe it\'s a hard balance because more is not always better. But in the reality of Google, more will, in fact, give you a higher search presence. </span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\'s a probability game. </span><b>Neil says </b><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/content-marketing-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>5.7 average</b></a><b> articles a week.</b></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first benefit of repurposing content is more content production and consistency. The method will help play the Google </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probability game</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a content piece and topic can have a blog post and a video blog post. It\'s similar content, but the video can have additional tips and advice. In this scenario, you created two content pieces.</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second benefit, and already mentioned, you can reduce the pressure to produce. Time and expectations are heavy pressure on content marketing managers. By repurposing </span><a href="https://www.bluleadz.com/blog/benefits-of-repurposing-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a manager can be smarter and share a great content idea into multiple formats.</span></span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima;">How to choose the best content piece to repurpose</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">When choosing the best content piece to repurpose and <em>exponentially</em> harness, it\'s best to run the numbers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">You choose a content piece that has potential. Meaning, the key topic should have a decent search volume (no less than three hundred a month), be a current popular topic already on a blog (with the numbers to prove it), or shared well on social media.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To choose the best repurpose piece, run the numbers and identify high performers. The high performer will likely be the best content piece to work with. To make it an exponential content piece, make sure it\'s not a closed topic piece. </span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By closed topic, I mean it should not be a topic you cannot generate new ideas, or easily manipulate into other content forms. It should have an exponential opportunity to grow. And add more value.\r\n</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it also in the way of a topic cluster. Choose a content piece that has many sub-topics. Use those sub-topics to repurpose into various forms of content. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right content piece for repurposing will be a better use of your time.</span></span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima;">5 clever tips to reuse content smartly</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content piece has been chosen and the plan is to turn it into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponential content.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The topic has been chosen, but the struggle remains on </span><em>what</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form to repurpose the content into.</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content that is quality can be re-created into a variety of formats. Try these 5 clever content formats:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Turn the content post into a series of short videos</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Re-create the content main idea into LinkedIn Slideshare slide decks</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Take a series of popular blog posts (or similar content) and re-work into a download eBook</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Write lengthy social media posts (or creative social visuals) regurgitating the content</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Turn the content post into a webinar series, record it, and offer it as a download</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Creating quality content doesn\'t have to be a challenge for content marketing managers. Most likely, you already have a high performer and overachiever in your content stack. <strong>Repurpose and reuse it smartly — and improve its potential.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="single solid" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Only a select few of these messages connect with recipients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can an online service provider stand out from the crowd? What is so different about these messages - and how do they capture the attention in the midst of the storm? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer: they have taken the time to identify their ideal audience and hone in on their </span><b>buyer persona.</b>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a buyer persona?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubspot</a>, a buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of the ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers. A buyer persona can go by many names. It will be often labeled as a buyer persona, ideal audience, ideal client, or customer profile. In this article, the word <strong>buyer persona</strong> will be used.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When creating a buyer persona, consider including marketing-relevant data such as the audience’s challenges, demographics, interests, pain-points, and goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A detailed persona is a crucial element to accurately understanding your audience - and therefore, to market to it. It is an excellent tool for understanding your customer’s needs and wants. In return, you craft quality content that meets their needs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once identified, all marketing efforts should speak to a marketing persona. The description includes as many details as possible, especially on fields or categories most relevant to a specific target. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To precisely determine the information that goes in these fields, your business has to do market research and measure customer data.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you need a buyer persona?</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to compete in the crowded digital landscape, the content has to be customized. It should speak to customer needs and interests. And if it does not, a message is simply unheard or surpassed by potential customers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">An B2B company can have more than one type of ideal audience. It could have two, three, or even four main audiences for persona creation.</span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a SaaS company that delivers email marketing software could create two buyer personas; one for big enterprises who mostly care about functionality, and another one for small businesses who are more worried about ease of use.</span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each audience group needs a personalized experience, and creating a persona for each customer group means that each one will be targeted with the right message.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For you, this personalized experience is important. Online competition is high and these individuals need to stand out by creating customized, helpful and converting content that begins with defining the buyer persona. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content begins with a buyer persona, and it is nearly impossible to hit the nail on the head without defining it as a first step of the process.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, many businesses skip on creating a detailed buyer persona because they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">like they understand their audience enough. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But more often than not, there are mistakes or new things to learn about an audience that does not rise to the surface until you write it down on paper.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to create a buyer persona</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have better insight into the benefits of a persona, it is time to craft your own. For a simple step-by-step process, follow the directions below.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Understand and research the audience. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a description with real-data, instead of with uneducated assumptions, is paramount. Gather information by creating surveys, doing market research, using social media, website analytics tools, or by interviewing clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data will help accurately describe the ideal audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Determine audience pain points and goals. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A buyer persona contains different description fields on customers’ characteristics - such as demographics, goals, job, values, and other traits.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all these fields, the most important ones to get right are pain-points and goals. Why? Because the goal of an online service provider’s content should be to </span>help customers achieve their goals and solve problems through quality content.\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Identify the basics.</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a few characteristics fields to define the buyer persona. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important fields of almost every buyer persona are goals, pain-points, demographics, firmographics (for B2B), and job title. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create fields relevant to a specific company. </span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in a loan company, a field called “budget” or “yearly salary” can help to better determine what offers to make to clients.</span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall when the time is taken to <a href="https://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/ideal-audience/">identify and befriend the buyer persona</a>, it can then be crafted into visual to be used as a reference every time new content is created. Here is an example:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3721077-Persona-User-research"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dribbble2.png" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></a></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process, it will take some research to fill in the blanks, so do not be surprised if it takes a few days to create the ultimate version of a buyer persona. Creating a buyer persona is the first (and arguably the most important) step in defining and creating content that is purposeful and converts to sales. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyer personas are more than a tool to increase the efficiency of marketing efforts and ROI. They are a representation of target audiences that allow us to more accurately and deeply understand how to create content, products, and services that suit them.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

When you listen to a podcast, you focus on one topic for up to forty-five minutes. Your brain is consumed on this topic, soaking it in, analyzing it, thinking about it, and commenting on it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in an attention scattered world. How many of you have more than five tabs open currently on your browser? (I sheepishly raise my hand.) Experts predict that we have as much as 60,000 – 80,000 thoughts a </span><a href="https://www.successconsciousness.com/blog/inner-peace/how-many-thoughts-does-your-mind-think-in-one-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> running through our heads!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have read many times and with various articles active learning happens when your mind is focused on a specific topic in a time interval. So, it might be time to cancel out those extra website tabs with the content marketing article that you do not seem to be reading.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If I want to read and digest quality information, I sit down and listen to a podcast. I believe it allows me to narrow into a specific niche and keep those 60,000 thoughts centered on one topic. And like I said, listening to a podcast is one of the best ways for me to learn new things and digest new information.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an online service provider, it is time to take the next step in your online marketing. I have said time and time again how content marketing should be a major pillar in your marketing strategy. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content will strengthen your online authority, attract traffic through an online search, nurture your prospects into buyers and grow your email list. It is the beginning building blocks to creating an online community that values your product/service and becomes a reoccurring audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I grow my content marketing knowledge base partly through content marketing podcasts, and the below are my top four.</span>\r\n<h2><strong># 1  This Old Marketing</strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-1938 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen_Shot_2015-06-01_at_5.48.28_PM-600x347.png" alt="" width="180" height="108" /></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I agree 100 percent with Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose when they mention that the concept of content marketing is not new. People like telling stories to attract and keep others interested. People listen to stories and build trust with the speaker through knowledge building and partnership. Old concepts; new medium. Listen to </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/pnr-with-this-old-marketing-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘This Old Marketing.’</span></a>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<h2><strong># 2  CopyBlogger FM</strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-1937 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lede-cover.png" alt="" width="152" height="161" />I would say CopyBlogger FM by Rainmaker Digital is a top in the industry. The host Sonia Simone really understands copywriting and content marketing. Her years of insight, trial and error and experience alone are a great resource in these short thirty-to-forty minute episodes. And she is not the only brains in the operation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone brings on the show content marketing industry experts to share their own advice and experiences. Why do I like CopyBlogger - because it digs down to the mechanics of quality content writing. Content is about helpful information, and it should be high-quality written content specifically for your audience.</span>\r\n<h2><strong># 3  HubSpot Skill Up</strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The HubSpot Skill Up podcast might not seem like a content marketing candidate at first glance, because the basis of this show is search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is a major step in making sure your content is distributed well and found online. Content should be made for your audience, but if your audience is not searching for that topic, is it really worth it? Skill Up will give you all the practical SEO tips and tricks to jumpstart your online content.</span>\r\n<h2><strong># 4  The Craft of Marketing</strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a bit late to the game with the podcast, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Craft of Marketing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it is still published online (or on podcasts streaming apps) and the wealth of content marketing knowledge has not gone away. Seth Price is the industry expert and voice behind the podcast, and he hosts a series of Marketing Directors and Content Leaders on the show to do a deep-dive into their experiences and lessons learned. That type of valuable information never expires.</span>\r\n\r\nI share a few more of my favourite content marketing podcasts on our MTC YouTube channel.\r\n\r\n[fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/KZG9vcs6wYA" alignment="center" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" css_id=""][/fusion_youtube]\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a founder of a startup, you have little time to dedicated to knowledge learning. Because of this, a morning commute or coffee-sitting time is a great time to digest new ideas and keep learning. If a content marketing strategy is on your agenda, these four content marketing podcasts will jumpstart the journey and make you into a marketing pro.</span>\r\n\r\nFurther reading on the MTC Blog:\r\n<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/content-marketing-strategy/">How to Begin a Content Marketing Strategy</a>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

When I approached my first client to develop a content marketing strategy, I was in all sorts of excitement and anticipation. Until that point, I had mentally developed the concept of what makes a good content marketing strategy via theory. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I read paragraphs and paragraphs of content marketing journals, and I went through <a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HubSpot’s content marketing course</a> to get a head start.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I followed marketing geniuses like <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Patel</a> who seemed to ‘get it’, and I would follow his concepts soaking it all in like a sponge in a bowl of water.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The information was valuable. I learned the concept of a strategic framework that would help online businesses build their organic website traffic and more leads. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It was like putting together a puzzle by arranging the pieces, re-arranging them again then finally seeing it click together. Click, click, click….</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>It’s how content strategy felt to me in the beginning. I was building my beginning approach; letting it grow and expedite.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Did I get it right? No, I didn’t get it 100% right the first time. I developed a content marketing strategy for my first client. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It did well by bringing in large amounts of organic traffic, but…</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It was unorganized.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It was ‘guesswork’ on the customer’s pain points and target topics.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">SEO was on the backburner.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I had made the largest mistake with my first client that I now preach and emphasize with my current clients to never do.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>I didn’t form a solid content marketing strategy and put it down on paper.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">….on paper! Yes, I didn’t even write it down. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Actually, I went 6 to 8 months testing multiple theories, until I finally read an article that convinced me to actually write the content marketing strategy and plan into a word document.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">How can we meet rocket performance and attract high-class online leads, <strong>IF</strong> we don’t have a strategy?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I learned from this experience. I fumbled my client’s first content marketing strategy by not doing the simplest of steps, and I made these mistakes.</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">I produced content without fully understanding the customer journey and target persona.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The first step in content creation was not to develop a marketing nurturing process to capture emails.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The content was just everywhere. It was unorganized, and we wrote articles based on a ‘hunch’ and not researched facts.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">There is a silver lining to this story. It’s the realization that we’re human and we learn. Mistakes are the greatest learning opportunity, and I’ve made a few when it comes to content marketing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Mistakes make us smarter</strong>, and I now know what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to generating a high-performing content marketing strategy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Did you know? Most organic traffic that enters a website is generated through a company blog. If that remains true, then a company blog should be one of the most important aspects of driving online growth.

It should be at the foundation of your marketing actions by providing the groundwork for a booming online business. Great content will make you a <strong>king</strong> on the web.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Customers are more educated and engaged in the buying process than ever before, and they demand relevant and useful information to inform their buying decision. Content marketing will educate customers, develop trust with them, nurture them in the sales cycle and more.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">What is Content Marketing?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing is the means of educating the customer about your products and services through relevant and helpful information. It’s a <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/">strategic</a> approach to distributing the <b>right</b> valuable and relevant content at the<b> right</b> time to attract and retain a clearly defined audience.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Brands of all sizes and industries are approaching content marketing as a key piece of their strategic marketing approach. Businesses and content marketers are coming to realization that content sells and generates more leads than traditional marketing methods.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">In fact, Demand Metric reports that content marketing generates <strong>over three times</strong> as many leads as outbound marketing and costs <a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">62%</a> less.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">It\'s also becoming expected. Business decision makers search for pieces of valuable content in the form of blog posts, eBooks, white papers, case studies and infographics to inform and guide their buying decision.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Stratabeat reports that <strong><a href="https://stratabeat.com/roi-of-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80%</a> of executives</strong> <strong>and business owners</strong> prefer to receive information about a company through articles rather than advertisements. Is this soft approach to marketing the new thing?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Decision makers are now making buying decisions based on relevant and informative content. A business providing the right and valuable information at the right time will have more luck in converting the \'learner\' into a sales lead and then a buying customer.</span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">Why does Content Marketing work?</span></strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">The statistics floating around in this blog post will tell you that content marketing is a growing field and <strong>it\'s hot</strong>. Businesses are jumping on board to develop content to strengthen their online presence with search websites, build SEO and establish their creditability with future customers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Why does it work? Content marketing works because it puts the most important person first, the customer. It approaches online selling through trust, authenticity and helpfulness.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">A witty content marketer will know their customer like a best friend. Wouldn\'t you want to help a friend out? They understand their needs, desires, problems and challenges. They approach their content as a means of helping and educating the reader towards ... success!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Producing the right content is also a means of weeding out those that you can <strong>and cannot</strong> help. There is no shame in someone landing on your blog and realizing your solution isn\'t for them. You educated them and helped them come to the realization that they needed to start elsewhere.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Content marketing for startups, small business, online entrepreneurs, and individuals alike benefit from increased sales, cost savings, and better customers with a stronger loyalty to your brand. Are you still not convinced? <em>These are 5 reasons you need it for your business.</em></span>\r\n<h2><strong><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 24pt;">5 reasons you need content marketing</span></strong></h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Builds trust with your audience.</b> By sharing content actively with your audience, you build trust with current and future customers rooted in the idea that you understand what you preach and eventually come across as a thought leader in the industry.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Builds authority online.</b> Customers resonate with smart companies that know what they’re talking about. By writing about relevant and timely topics related to your industry, you build authority and thought leadership among your customers.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>SEO loves content.</b> Google and other search engineers were created to connect people with information and when you provide expert and helpful information through content, Google will recognize this and boost the content higher in the search ranking. The higher you are, the more likely you’re to receive high and relevant traffic to your website.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Content supports your paid marketing.</b> If you’re dumping thousands of dollars into paid Google, social and other paid online advertising with little results, there’s a better way. I see many businesses setting-up paid marketing funnels without the ‘nurturing process’ in place. They create optimized landing pages that are a type of cold sales pitch that seldom attracts the right customers or attracts the right customers that aren’t ready to buy right then &amp; there. Content marketing should be coupled with your paid marketing by means of a nurturing strategy and a valuable automated content distribution.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Content nurtures your audience and advances the sales cycle.</b> When a customer approaches your business, they’re at different crossroads in their buying journey. Some might be looking for educational materials and others might be searching for use cases on a product solution. Purposefully created content will attract the right customers and convert them into the funnel for nurturing until they’re ready to buy. By aligning content with the buyer’s needs, a business is more likely to navigate the busy path from learning customer to buyer.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Good news: content is already integrated into your marketing processes - it’s not a new method. You’ve used content by writing social media posts, writing a press release, developing copy for your website and writing business brochures. You have the content, but now it\'s time to create it with the strategic thinking hat on.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">If your business isn\'t onboard, you might be losing out on relevant prospects for your business. Content has always been a central player in a business’s life; however, <strong>without a strategy</strong> that valuable content might’ve been useless.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">We now understand content marketing is important, and we have to be aware of it. We also understand that it\'s a large sales converter, and we should get onboard to create the right content for our customers and to feed it to them at the right time. Doing content correctly begins with the fundamental groundwork of understanding the <strong>customer journey and target personas</strong>.</span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;"><b>It’s time to </b><b>bridge</b><b> valuable content with a strong strategy that focuses on the customer journey and targeted personas.</b></span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-family: optima; font-size: 14pt;">Understanding and developing a customer journey roadmap and a targeted persona is the next piece of the puzzle.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

My experiences go something like this:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sitting in an Airbnb with my mother one Michigan summer evening, and I blurted out - quite quickly - What is feminism to you? My mother’s reaction was of shock, and I wouldn’t advise thrusting such a heavy loaded question on your next-to-kin without preparing them for the conversation first.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother’s reaction was shocking, and she honestly couldn’t form an answer. I could see the images of women yelling, taking off their shirts, and the men’s reactions to feminism rushing behind her eyelids. It is a touchy topic, and I’m still trying to understand how to best approach the topic with new people.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother isn’t the only one. I’ve had similar reactions to this simple question from multiple individuals both men and women. When I take the time to explain the definition of feminism, I receive a “here, here!” and a “yes, I agree!” This tells me that the definition of feminism is in people’s hearts, and they agree with it. They agree with equality.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id="1379" max_width="" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="center" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="https://mailchi.mp/4567cff13b42/resourcelibrary" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/purpsoe-banner.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_text columns="" column_min_width="" column_spacing="" rule_style="default" rule_size="" rule_color="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]\r\n<h2>What is feminism?</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s clear it up. If you look up the word feminism is the dictionary, you will see this list of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2017/03/08/what-is-feminism-and-why-do-so-many-women-and-men-hate-it/#52aa3cf17e8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explanations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The advocacy of women\'s rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you can lean to at least one of these definitions. I most closely identify with #2, and that is the definition that I convey to people when I meet facial reactions of worry, fear, awkward, and confused. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe this is partly due to what is called the second wave of the feminist movement.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1432 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/THW_5817-copy_opt.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="599" />During </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3292948/redefining-the-f-word-what-does-feminism-look-like-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second-wave feminism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which started in the early 1960s through the 1980s, many women distanced themselves from the movement for fear of being lumped in with the stereotype of a feminist: a woman who is pushy, brash, doesn’t shave her legs and above all else, hates men.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother’s reaction to feminism is rooted in this second-wave, and if we are to exit from it, <strong>we have to modernize feminism.</strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that it’s irrational to think that we can continue to view feminism with the same lenses as the last century. The last century held strong achievements for women, including the right to vote, pregnancy and age discriminatory laws across career fields. The work was tough, and women (&amp; men) worked hard through blood and tears to achieve what I have today. And I’m grateful.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean we can’t stop pushing. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many people in the world that believe the fight has been </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2017/03/08/what-is-feminism-and-why-do-so-many-women-and-men-hate-it/#3a0375a77e8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and women are now equal to men.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of youth and ignorance, I used to have this view also.

We still need feminism, why?</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On average, women earn </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/international-womens-day-2018-statistics-numbers-female-lives-feminism-gender-pay-gap-a8244101.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> percent less than men.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/shocking-facts-gender-inequality-international-wom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the number of women government parliamentary members in the world.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><a href="https://everydaysexism.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 percent </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of speaking roles in Hollywood films are men (although actresses are 5 times more likely to be asked to get naked than their male counterparts).</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And with these numbers, I’m not even including the </span><a href="https://www.makers.com/blog/21-facts-you-never-knew-about-international-gender-inequality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the number of women homeless, sexually abused, victims of domestic violence, and inequality across industries.

We should also be critical of how modern feminism has played out; it shouldn’t be a selfish pursuit.</span>\r\n<h2>What is a modern day feminist?</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We do need to modernize feminism because the tactics that worked the past 100-years will not all work today. We need to modernize our voices, how we communicate about feminism - it’s about more than just women - and rally our best allies into the playing field - MEN. Men are our greatest allies, and we need to have them on our side if we are to close the remaining gap of inequality.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/dYyN43yMByg" alignment="" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" /][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_text columns="" column_min_width="" column_spacing="" rule_style="default" rule_size="" rule_color="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This video sums up what a modern day feminist is to me. We have to wade through the negativity that has pegged this term - not just feminism, but modern feminism - and create something positive. A feminist isn’t about shaming men. It’s not about complaining. It’s not about cursing, or playing the mean woman that puts others down. </span>\r\n<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a DIFFERENCE between strength and a bully. Search your morals. Look to elementary school. You will know the difference. </span></blockquote>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A modern day feminist means several things to me:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s someone that hasn’t accepted the status quo. You can look at how far we’ve come and celebrate. Please celebrate, but please don’t settle. A modern day feminist keeps pushing the status quo. Fighting for true equality; not the second place.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s someone that puts on the hat of the questioner. They question everything and encourage people to think! Do you agree with the current gender structures in society, home, and business? Do you agree with the current choices that are given to women, and that are not given? Do you think this is the way it’s supposed to be?</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s someone that believes in choice. A women has choice over what she wears, who she is, and what she does with her body without social redicual. If you want to wear the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-emmawatson-idUSKBN16C0QV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexy dress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; wear it and with confidence. It’s also important to say that this “me” movement in modern feminism is about you, but it’s ALSO about others. I encourage you to look broader. Fight for the choices of all women, because we are in this together.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s someone that believes in equality for ALL. I will admit it - and write it down to remind myself - I am a privileged white women, upper class, and living in a modernized country. I’m very lucky! It’s now time to focus on the collective. Feminism used to just be about the inequality between men and women. It’s now an inequality fight between women of different backgrounds, cultures, statuses, and races. Diversity is the future of the world. It brings strength, so a modern day feminist is someone that believes in the equality of ALL. Even the equality of men. I want to see more men in elementary education, as nurses, and in stereotypical women roles. I want equality for all.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_youtube id="https://youtu.be/-o2lhu7ffFY" alignment="" width="" height="" autoplay="false" api_params="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" /][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_text columns="" column_min_width="" column_spacing="" rule_style="default" rule_size="" rule_color="" class="" id=""]\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, modern day feminism can mean many different points. The largest one would be the last. We modernize feminism by adding it to the larger discussion of inequality across all factions of society. I’m a feminist, and I will say it proudly. I believe in the equality of all.</span>\r\n<h2><strong>What do you believe?</strong></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more on the subject:</span>\r\n<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2018/11/21/feminist-podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMINIST PODCASTS: 5 SHOWS YOU WANT TO FOLLOW</span></a>\r\n<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2018/09/14/word-women-women-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARE WE READY TO DITCH THE WORD ‘WOMEN’ IN WOMEN LEADERSHIP?</span></a>\r\n<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2018/09/04/women-leadership-conferences-must-attend-events-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WOMEN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCES: MUST ATTEND EVENTS 2019</span></a>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type="none" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" sep_color="" top_margin="" bottom_margin="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" /][fusion_imageframe image_id="1222" max_width="" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="center" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="https://mailchi.mp/4567cff13b42/resourcelibrary" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

			'It\'s Tuesday. I have a twenty-minute commute to work that consists of a bus ride and a quick ride on the underground. The underground is one of those places that we must all endure, daily, and we seem to have a love and hate relationship with it.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried to make eye contact with humans on the underground? It usually goes like this: Hey, she\'s wearing a nice scarf. Oh, now, I\'m looking too long; too long. She saw me. We made eye contact. Enter: awkward feelings.\r\n\r\nThe daily commute to work can be long and sometimes a bit awkward. That is why I like to fill in the empty space with insightful podcasts and disappear into a good conversation. I\'ve recently been taking a step into great feminist podcasts educating myself on statistics, tips, and great stories that are empowering and helpful.\r\n\r\nIt\'s time to share that insight with you.\r\n\r\nI\'ve really enjoyed these feminist podcasts and staying up-to-date on current issues and advice from <strong>HUMANS</strong> that have been there.

The world is a complicated, busy and beautiful place, and it\'s full of humans moving in constant motion. And it never seems to end. There are always those in need or those issues that we\'re working on to make a change (i.e. equality). We all have our passion projects and missions in life.\r\n\r\nAs an American, I grew up in a culture that made me feel like I needed it all and I wanted it all. When I was growing up, I felt it around me, but once I started to travel, I realized how much I already had and that <strong>it was time not to get but to give.</strong> Travel is an eyeopening experience for a young person, and I will always be a personal advocate.\r\n\r\nBut growing up in the land of opportunity, I had this feeling of "needing to do it all" and be multi-talented, to be well-rounded and to be very successful. I had to find my passion and quick. I am sure these types of phrases went in all sorts of forms during my growing years, but now as an adult, it\'s causing difficulties.\r\n\r\nI am realizing that I cannot do it all. I cannot help everyone in the world. I can be talented at many things, but I can\'t be an expert at everything. It\'s difficult to be the wonder woman of humans.\r\n<h3>And why should I?</h3>\r\nAfter reading the book by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/margaretperlis/2013/10/29/5-characteristics-of-grit-what-it-is-why-you-need-it-and-do-you-have-it/#2b4ff5a34f7b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angela Duckworth</a> called "Grit", I started to think hard about my relationship with this "needing to do it all". Her focus is on resilience and perseverance. I\'ve had the word resilience in my head since university, but it wasn\'t until I read her book that I thought of a way to apply the newly founded knowledge.\r\n<blockquote>“<a href="https://www.powerofpositivity.com/difference-between-passion-and-purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purpose</a> is not selfish. It involves serving others, but it’s not servitude. It’s feeling joyful about creating joy. It’s about adding value in the lives of others while creating value in your life. It’s win – win."</blockquote>\r\nI wrote down, on a very extensive list, my \'passions\', talents, and interests. This was overwhelming enough, but once I started to visualize it, I realized that many of the topics had something in common. I enjoyed writing. I enjoyed meeting people from different cultures. I enjoyed educating people on topics I felt important. I enjoyed helping people. I enjoyed motivating people and encouraging them positively. I\'d sit and listen to people\'s challenges, and I would come to solutions. I\'ve always been the challenge to solution maker. That is just how my brain ticks.\r\n\r\nFrom this thought process, I created a vague purpose or mission statement for myself, then I reworked it and reworked it. It didn\'t need to be perfect, but it needed to feel like me. This was the conclusion:\r\n<h3 style="text-align: center;">Purpose: I elevate humans and help them reach their full potential.</h3>\r\nThe great thing about creating a purpose statement, it has the opportunity to grow. In my head, a passion can be narrowly focused on one topic. You can be passionate about music. You can be passionate about travel, but the word purpose has room for growth.\r\n<blockquote>“If you wanted to start a campfire with passion and purpose, you’d start with a foundation of wood (your purpose), and start the flame with a match (your passion).” – <em>Jessica Lauren DeBry</em></blockquote>\r\n<strong>My purpose has room to grow.</strong> Right now, I see myself fulfilling my purpose statement by writing about women leadership and feminism. I\'m encouraging, supporting, elevating and giving women the information needed to advance their personal goals. It can change in the future. Maybe I could write for a larger institution, or do small online classes. The purpose is a lifelong movement, and <strong>we stay resilient</strong> with it by keeping it flexible and making our goals manageable.\r\n<h3>That is my purpose in action, now, but I do expect it to change.</h3>\r\nMy last point on purpose over passion. Angela\'s book settled on the word resilience. Under my purpose statement, I can create big, small, short-term, long-term actions and goals to meet and fulfill my mission statement. A big goal - like this purpose statement can build - will take a lifetime to build. I better get to work and step-by-step, little goal by little goal, I will reach larger goals that are still nestled in my purpose. My passion statement truly isn\'t an end goal; instead, <strong>it is a growing and morphing entity that will grow with me</strong> and keep me pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI\'m focusing my energy around this mission statement. My goals and actions in life will aim to fulfill this passion statement in some way. It can be small moves or big moves. It doesn\'t matter; this is my guiding compass. <strong>Have you thought about your life mission?</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It was one of those rainy days in September that was foretelling the approaching fall and winter. I was pretty ecstatic because it meant tights and sweater weather. Simple joys in life.\r\n\r\nIt was a coffee meet up with a group of strong and supportive women. I told them about my thesis on women leadership and my struggle to get people to take my survey.\r\n\r\nOne of the women suggested that the reason might be because my thesis is on women leadership and not just leadership. <strong>I’m focusing on a woman as a defined group from the rest.</strong>\r\n<h2>Is she right?</h2>\r\nI understand her concerns. I dream of a day when we do not have to put individual emphasis on a suppressed group in order to progress change. When that time comes, it would have meant we achieved gender equality, and there is no need for differentiation.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, I more than anything wish I could just say ‘leadership’ and not ‘women leadership’. This would mean that we’ve reached a level of equality, where opportunities are equal, stereotypes are gone and humans are not held back by social-generated categories.\r\n\r\nI dream of this today. But the truth is we are not close. I used to believe the fight for equality was a past generation\'s fight, but it’s not. It’s a continued and steady fight for parity. Yes, we can’t fight with the same methods as the 1950s-60s, but we risk moving backward if we don’t continue to support gender equality advances.\r\n\r\nThis is why I am writing this thesis. To get people thinking. To bring a voice of optimism to a rather suppressed field (STEM) that lacks equality. To tell the story of those that have succeeded and given the tools to the next generation of women leaders so that they can be two steps ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is why I’m writing my thesis. Are we ready to ditch “women” from women leadership? My answer is no. Until I see statistics that reflect parity across ALL career fields, I will continue to encourage women directly to advance in leadership and fight for equal say, equal pay, equal whatever.\r\n\r\nI wish we were ready. For my own sake! As someone entering the workforce at 26-years-old. I wish it would be easy for me, but it will not be. We change the approach, but the steady equality fight continues. Are we ready to ditch the word “women” from women leadership?\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

			'If you\'re someone like me, you find informational talks and conferences about women leadership exciting. I know, going to conferences can be a weird concept. Why would you want to network and put yourself out there with a group of strangers? It\'s vulnerable. It\'s scary. I know. I get it.\r\n\r\nI remember the first time I went to a business networking event. I put on my best business suit - I was 21 - and I did a mini-pep talk in the car before I walked through the door. I remember feeling vulnerable, unsure and ridiculous. I didn\'t know what I was doing. I\'m a natural introvert, so pushing myself through that door was an achievement. And once I found the power to do it once, twice - <strong>THREE TIMES</strong> - I finally had a structure and a routine that I could use to commit to attending networking events.\r\n<h2>And my confidence grew.</h2>\r\nNetworking (or attending events) is one of the key parts of career advancement and the experts say women struggle with it. [Hey, I struggled with it!] Networking expands business opportunities and meaningful connections with role models and business leaders that make decisions. The informal relationships made with fellow humans provides new career advancement opportunities, ability to share ideas, to learn something new, or have that voice at the table. <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/11/12/why-women-should-do-less-and-network-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a> sums it up pretty well, "A central part of leadership is sharing experiences, meeting others, and learning from people inside and out of the office." If it\'s so important, then let\'s do it.\r\n\r\nI truly believe practice makes perfect. After that first event, I\'ve attended countless other events, and I stood in front of these groups and gave presentations. It takes practice and confidence, which are two things in your grasp to build.\r\n\r\nDespite our uncomfortableness with networking (or conferencing), it\'s important to make connections, build networks and seek out mentors/sponsors. This type of activity will boost our chances of sitting at that influential seat at the table.\r\n\r\nAny type of networking event can have a positive impact. It\'s doesn\'t have to be just women-related, small, big, or international. The point is to make meaningful connections - <strong>and to support other women in their career pursuits.</strong>\r\n\r\nHere are multiple conferences that I\'m looking forward to this year. I\'m not sure I\'ll be able to attend all of them, but I\'m enthusiastic about the vibe of these great events.\r\n<h2>Women Leadership Conferences</h2>\r\n<div>September 2018 - <a href="https://www.leadandinspire.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lead and Inspire Leadership Conference</a></div>\r\n<div>Las Vegas, Nevada; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>September 2018 - <a href="http://www.winconference.net/WINCONFERENCE_WEB/UK/PL-Landing-3.awp?AWPID096E75AE=E11018E4644D82B259536BA68C050744D0808CF8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global WINConference</a></div>\r\n<div>Rome, Italy</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>November 2018 - <a href="https://www.europeanwomenintech.com/agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Women in Tech</a></div>\r\n<div>Amsterdam, Netherlands</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>November 2018 - <a href="https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/special-events/tedwomen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEDWomen</a></div>\r\n<div>Palm Springs, California; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>March 2019 - <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/catalyst-award" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalyst Awards &amp; Conference</a></div>\r\n<div>New York, New York; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>April 2019 - <a href="https://wonderwomentech.com/conferences/london/london-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Women in Tech</a></div>\r\n<div>London, United Kingdom</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>May 2019 - <a href="https://www.diversity-in-technology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversity in Technology</a></div>\r\n<div>London, United Kingdom</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>May 2019 - <a href="http://winsummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WIN Summit</a></div>\r\n<div>New York, New York; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>June 2019 - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-live/event/womens-summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes Women\'s Summit</a></div>\r\n<div>New York, New York; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>June 2019 - <a href="https://www.nafe.com/tags/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAFE Women\'s Leadership Conference</a></div>\r\n<div>TBD</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>June 2019 - <a href="https://www.ellevatenetwork.com/events/7438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobilizing the Power of Women</a></div>\r\n<div>New York, New York; USA</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>August 2019 - <a href="http://femalefutureforceday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Female Future Force Day</a></div>\r\n<div>Berlin, Germany</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>August 2019 - <a href="https://conferences.blogher.com/blogher18cs-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlogHer</a></div>\r\n<div>Several Locations</div>\r\nDo you see yourself attending one of these events?

As a city soaked in years of history, cultures and stories, it’s hard to come to one simple conclusion about Berlin. As a 6-month expat living in Berlin, I’ve found the city to be like the ultimate college road trip. It’s fun, entertaining, sometimes rough around the edges, but overall you create memorable experiences. Whether you move to Berlin for a career change, in pursuit of a higher education or simply looking for a new lifestyle, Berlin offers multiple and diverse chapters for your life story.\r\n\r\nBerlin might seem like a new idea to you, but for others, it’s already been home to many. Berlin has become a cultural, international and creative hubspot in Europe. The city has seen an average of <a href="http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/business-location/business-location/economic-data/demographic-data">48,700 resident increase over the last five years</a>. And the age of Berlin resides between young and younger. With 54% of the population under the age of 45 in 2015, and an average age of 42.7. Don’t forget women being at 50.6% of the population. Berlin offers opportunities for all residents of multiple cultures, backgrounds and ages. Foreign born residents in Berlin hover around <a href="http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/business-location/business-location/economic-data/demographic-data">18% of the population</a>. It’s part of what makes Berlin, Berlin. It’s a city of diversity, opportunity and growth. So if you’re a foreigner or “Ausländer” looking to move abroad, Berlin will be the perfect fit for you. If you wish to be in the center of an up and coming cosmopolitan city, Berlin should be at the top of your list.\r\n\r\nYou’re convinced that Berlin is the next move in your personal and career life. Now, it’s time to prepare physically and mentally for the move abroad. These are five tips to help you make it as a female expat in Berlin.\r\n<h2>Learn German</h2>\r\n“Guten Tag” “Wo ist der Supermarket?” These are all important words and phrases to learn before your move to Berlin. Many people might tell you that Germans speak english, and it’s not necessary to learn German. In fact, Germany stands well above the European average (of 56%) of spoken English. According to the <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20151103/germany-slips-in-english-proficiency-table">EF’s English Proficiency Index (EPI)</a>, english is spoken by around 62% of the population, but where you’re likely to find an english speaker on the streets, for your long term happiness and success in Germany, it’s suggested to learn German.\r\n\r\nLearning German doesn’t have to be painful, though it’s a very hard language. To be successful in your first six months abroad, it’s suggested to be a B1 (Advanced Beginner) in German. At B1, you’ll begin sharing your opinion in German, and you won’t feel lost and confused when a train is cancelled. You’ll be able to ask “what’s the problem?” in German, making you feel more connected and less lost. Also, telling the taxi cab driver, “Ich möchte nicht” when you’re not interested in going out for a coffee is very important and useful.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there’s a huge amount of resources on the internet to jumpstart your language skills before you come to Germany. A few suggestions: <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>, <a href="https://uk.babbel.com">Babbel</a>, and a German local startup <a href="https://www.lingoda.com/en">Lingoda</a>. When you arrive in Berlin, we suggest <a href="https://www.die-deutschule.de/en/">die deutSCHule</a> and <a href="http://www.deutschakademie.de/berlin-german-course/">DeutschAkademie Sprachschule Berlin</a> to continue your German language journey.\r\n<h2>Connect with Other Career Driven Expats</h2>\r\nBerlin is the capital of Germany, so when it comes to finding other ‘like-minded’ career individuals it’s relatively easy. The city has a wide population of different fields, businesses and careers. Because of this diversity, you’ll be pretty lucky in finding a local group in your profession. Facebook is your number one resource when looking for career-support groups. A few favorites include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/women.in.tech.berlin/">Women in Tech Berlin</a> which aims to “get together women that work in tech, as well as women entrepreneurs, women that are working on their own business ideas, or women that just love tech &amp; startups.” Further, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/171912489581438/">Berlin Geekettes</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/berlintravelmassive/">Berlin Travel Massive</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/berlinstartups/">Berlin Startup Employees</a> all are great support groups to connect with locals in multiple fields and networks. Networking is key! Furthermore, don’t forget that traditional networking groups exist in Germany. If you’re part of the Optimist Club, or Lion’s Club in the United States, these types of groups also exist in Berlin. The <a href="http://www.biwc.de">Berlin International Women’s Club</a> is on the top of my list.\r\n<h2>Integrate Into The University Scene</h2>\r\nWe should never stop learning, and moving to a new country is learning in itself. Supplementing your career with new skills will make you more competitive in your field. Luckily, Berlin hosts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_and_research_institutions_in_Berlin">four public universities and 27 private and technical colleges</a>. This number is also growing. To begin your higher education search, the website MasterStudies.com helps you find local universities searchable by your background and interest. If you’re not interested in a full degree, remember that these universities offer open, free seminars and workshops. These are great opportunities to network, and hear lectures from local professors.\r\n<h2>Form Your Inner Friend Circle</h2>\r\nMuch like connecting with other career-driven individuals, it’s just as important to make good friends when going abroad. Friendships are what makes the feeling of being far away from home bearable. It’s connections with others that help you make a new place feel like home. Luckily, Berlin offers several, several groups for you to connect with others. Depending on your interests, a few top groups to find local friends are: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/makefriendsinberlin/">Make Friends in Berlin</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GGIBerlin/">Berlin | Girls Gone International,</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/berlinexpats/">berlin EXPATS</a>. The individuals in these groups are in the same ‘shoes’ as you. They also search for new friends, and ways to make Berlin feel more like home. Usually, these groups meet up in local bars in Berlin and form groups to attend the many Berlin events taking place everyday.\r\n<h2>Find a Few German Friends</h2>\r\nThis might seem silly, but it’s very common to find expats teaming up with fellow friends from their personal home countries. Because, why not? You automatically have something in common, so it’s completely understandable. However, for your long term happiness and success in Germany, it’s advised to find a few German friends. Besides, you live in Germany. What better way to integrate into the local culture, learn German and feel like an ‘honorary’ German than to find local German friends. You’re in Germany to advance your career, but there’s more to life than working a 9-5 job. Connections, friends and experiences are what will make your time in Berlin, Germany truly a memorable experience. Plus, what better way to learn how to “prost” [cheers] in German than drinking local German beer with Germans in a local German bar, and learning how to “clink” your glass in just the right German way.\r\n\r\nIf you’re an inspiring expat, it’s completely doable for you to “make it” in Berlin. Berlin can very possibly be the next exciting, enriching and treasurable chapter in your life story. Use these five tips to jump start your adventure abroad.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Being the capital and a multinational city, language schools have sprung into new locations across metropolitan Berlin. It doesn\'t matter what part of the city you live, there seems to be a language school within distance. Which is a huge plus. Let\'s get started with \'Deutsch\' learning.\r\n\r\nEvery school is a little bit different. Some offer many different choices, teachers and flexible schedule options. If you look at one school but don\'t see what you wish, you\'ll most likely find the offering at another school. In my experience, smaller is better, and closer to home. When you wake at 7:00am to make your 8:00am class every morning, it helps for the school to be just down the road - not to mention extremely convenient.\r\n\r\nDuring my seven months in Berlin, I\'ve tried three different schools. It wasn\'t because I hated a certain experience. Rather, it was due to wanting to try something new, pricing and location. About pricing, with the increased competition of courses in Berlin, you can now find classes for under €250 with no registration fee. So you should keep this price in mind when scouting a language school. Further, in my experience, the lecturer is really what makes and breaks an experience. If with in the first few classes you\'re not \'feeling\' the lecturer, I\'d suggest moving to another class. You\'re paying for it, so no harm in asking to move.\r\n\r\n<strong>Okay, you\'re ready to book that language course. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Decide if you want an intensive course that\'s typically Monday through Friday, three hours a day.</li>\r\n \t<li>Or if you\'d like to spread the course out over three months, one evening a week. In other words, how intensive do you want to be and how much time do you have?</li>\r\n \t<li>Classes typically go like this: Beginner to Advanced (A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, A2.2, B1.1, B1.2, B2.1, B2.2 and C1). Each level is an individual course, and you\'re not considered intermediate until you reach B2. Based on my own experience, working up until at least B1 will get you by in everyday life (i.e. at the supermarket). If you go intensive, this should take you about five months of instruction.Okay, you\'re convinced. These are a few schools from my experience that worked out pretty well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a href="http://www.deutschakademie.de"><strong>DeutschAkademie:</strong></a> They have two locations, one in Alexander Platz and in West Berlin. They\'re both very conveniently located. It\'s clean classrooms, good lecturers, easy-going environment and professional. I took two courses here, and I was satisfied. However, I do believe they\'re a bit expensive (compared to what\'s popping up in Berlin), and the front staff wasn\'t always organized.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="http://www.die-deutschule.de/en/#">die deutschule:</a></strong> I moved to this location, because it was much closer to my house. It cut the travel time in half! I really liked this language school in Neukölln. It has a bit of a hipster vibe, plus a coffee shop right in the school! It\'s cheaper than DeutschAcademie.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="http://www.anda-sprachschule.de/en/">Anda Spracheschule:</a></strong> New month, new language school. With my intensive schedule, I could no longer do 4-5 classes a week, so I searched for an opportunity that gave me one class a week over three months. I\'d still be learning German, but slower. This little school in Friedrichshain was the perfect fit.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="https://www.lingoda.com/en">Lingoda Online:</a> </strong>If you\'re looking for something even more convenient, look to these online courses. It\'s from a local startup in Berlin with high-rated lecturer reviews at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nIt\'s Berlin, so there\'s many more language school options than these four included here. No worries. You\'ll find your perfect school. Shop around on Google, and reach out to the many Berlin Expat Facebook groups to ask individual\'s opinions on schools that they\'ve attended. Viel Spaß![/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It intellectually enchances your being, and it connects you to a new people and cultures in a way not thought possible. I always thought I was terrible at languages, and I kind of am, with this said I never thought I\'d find myself living in Germany and trying to learn German. News flash, German is not an easy language!\r\n\r\nBut the experience has been great. Yes, I\'ve cried out in frustration, but overall, I\'m happy to be learning German. Now I know many expats have come to German without learning German, and still after several years, they\'re German isn\'t so great. I get it, when it\'s expensive, hard and you know over half the German population speaks English, it\'s hard to find the motivation to sit in a classroom for 12 hours a week.\r\n\r\nIt\'s worth it. I assure you! The reality, learning the local language connects you to the people and culture in ways I didn\'t think possible. Even if you try to speak German, you develop a sudden respect and appreciation for your efforts. There\'s also words that only be expressed by the German language, and well, English doesn\'t always cut it for those most crafty of words. Have you heard of the word "Wanderlust"? German.\r\n\r\nSo, if I still haven\'t convinced you, these are 5 reasons to learn German before moving abroad.\r\n<h2>It connects you with the people.</h2>\r\nYes, I\'v not trying to be all supplemental here, but when you try to speak the local language, you suddenly earn a lot of respect with the locals. There\'s also several ways to express yourself in German that\'s not easily similar to in the English language.\r\n<h2>It keeps you independent.</h2>\r\nBy independence, I mean you\'re not dragging a German to translate for you at the supermarket, or even the bank to open a bank account. These everyday experiences don\'t require A+ German, and you can most likely get by with broken German learned in your Intermediate B1 German class. Part of the reason of being an expat is independence, and a language shouldn\'t be a barrier in front of that.\r\n<h2>You can get yourself out of circumstances.</h2>\r\nThese \'circumstances\' could be anything. If you understand the basics of the language, you can understand when the S-Bahn is cancelled due to weather conditions, or when an accident happens and you must make a call to the emergency services. Ora circumstance that I believe knowing German is very useful, when you get "hit on" by the Turkish cab driver when coming home late from a music concert. The best phrase for these situation is "<span lang="de">Ich möchte night."</span>\r\n<h2>You can share in on the German jokes.</h2>\r\nAnd you have to give it to the Germans, they can find some pretty funny jokes. Usually the jokes revolve around the spoken language not being completely correct - wow, the German made a mistake - but it gives to know a little German to laugh when the jokes start coming around.\r\n\r\nBerlin being an international city, it\'s sometimes hard to find the concrete reasons to learn a hard language. I constantly struggle with it, but when it starts to \'click\' you suddenly feel connect to the people, the culture and the jokes on an entirely new level. In Berlin, I suggest starting your German-learning adventure at <a href="https://www.die-deutschule.de/en/">die deutSCHule</a>, <a href="http://www.deutschakademie.de/berlin-german-course/">DeutschAkademie Berlin</a> and <a href="https://www.lingoda.com/en">Lingoda</a>.\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

That’s my lame excuse for neglecting my blog, and never writing. The summer is coming to a close, and I’m mentally preparing for a time [really] soon that will involve cold weather and multiple layers of clothing. It’s been over ten years since I’ve experienced Fall, Winter and cold weather. I’m excited about the Fall. The changing leaves, pumpkin spiced lattes and sweater weather. I remember growing up in California and getting excited when the weather brought two days of 65 degrees and rain. The Californians ran to our closest and dusted off our sweaters in boots.\r\n\r\nBut more has been happening in life than weather preparation. I’m approaching my sixth month abroad, and I can finally say that I feel ‘settled.’ I have my favorite coffee shops, Sunday parks and a simple [but crazy] routine. Life feels good, organised and complete. It’s finally starting to feel like my own creation, and something that I put together and created.\r\n\r\nThis Fall, I’m full swing into writing my thesis. It’s been neglected, and the idea is to really graduate at a decent time. So, when the days are dark and cold, you’ll find me inside writing and researching life crazy, dreaming of warmer days.\r\n<h2>SUMMER TRAVEL</h2>\r\nTravel was full of adventures, so it makes since that I didn’t spend much time inside writing a paper. In May, I traveled to Riga, Latvia. It’s a superb little town, still in the EU. The buildings are beautiful, and it was relatively cheap. The beginning of July, I took a quick weekend to London. London is a beaut. Traveling solo is always great, but when you’re with good friends, my opinion better memories are made. End of July, the boyfriend and I took off for a week in Northern Poland. Poland is a untouched beauty, cheap with fantastic food and sights. The coast was great to road trip along, and I’m still drooling over my pictures of Gdansk. The beginning of August, I took myself to Lisbon, Portugal. I’m happy to report that all the fantastic tales and observations are true. Portugal is a fab place, and you need to make sure it’s on your travel list.\r\n<h2>FALL PREPARATION</h2>\r\nFall is coming, then winter, but I’m more excited about Fall. The Fall will be full of plenty of pictures of the changing leaves, hot wine and short weekend trips. Next month, the boyfriend and I are headed to west Germany to enjoy family and small town time. What were your adventures this summer?\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

There’s something about the small, alley roads and tile designs that cover Lisbon which makes it so special. This photographer was drooling over the photos, so when I had the opportunity to take a week trip to Lisbon, I jumped on it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisbon is known for its seven hills of elegant beauty. Between these hills lie charming neighborhoods of peeling paint, bright colors and old grandmothers listening to classical music. The daily life vibe in these areas are relaxing and quiet. This was perfect for the summer holiday that I was looking for.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you visit Lisbon, expect to walk. It’s hilly - hello seven hills - but walking is the best way to see the side streets and little hidden places. Everything is downhill towards the water, so I’ve been making a habit of walking downhill in the mornings when it cool, and taking the public transportation back uphill when it’s hot in the afternoons. This digital nomad has to work at some point.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you plan your walking tour, make sure these four colorful neighborhoods are on your list.</span>\r\n<h2>Graça</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This area is iconic, because in the middle sits the Castello or fortress. The neighborhood is up and down hills, little side streets and quiet restaurants on the sidewalks. Expect many tourists in this area, but it’s a must see, because of the beautiful view it gives of Lisbon. </span>\r\n<h2>Rato</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A very quiet area where you can escape the tourists. It’s easy to become lost in the side streets. My suggestion is to stay away from the larger roads, and always travel the back roads.</span>\r\n<h2>Avenidas Novas</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bit outside of the tourist hub - which is why I like it - this was the area that I stayed for the week in my hostel. The area was more modern, but a great place full of restaurants, young families and safe locations. The water was easily accessible by metro and bus from this location, and I recommend picking your accommodation in this area.</span>\r\n<h2>Bairro Alto</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">By far, this was my favorite neighborhood in Lisbon. It’s beautiful, colorful and great for a morning stroll. It’s also a wonderful area full of hostels and bars. It’s hippy and trendy. At the top of the district, a view from Miracouro de Sao is a must see. My favorite coffee shop in the area was The Mill.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisbon didn’t disappoint. It was the perfect summer escape to a colorful and charming destination. On your visit, walk these beautiful four neighborhoods to experience the real Lisbon.</span>\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;"></div>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Why, Berlin has many perks. In 2016, Berlin was ranked as the cheapest city in Europe by independent.co.uk. Let’s just say that means more cheap German beer, fun nights out with the friends and weekend travel trips. Heck yes.

I’m not saying it’s easy, but if we force ourselves into the situation, usually we overcome the obstacles. It’s been almost five months since I moved to my beloved Berlin. I remember my moving day like it was yesterday. It was a perfect combination of excitement, fear and anxiety. That wasn’t the best combination for my stomach. I was excited about moving to Berlin, but  in a lot of ways, I was in the dark. I had painted Berlin as this savor place, with beautiful landscapes and perfectness. Nothing could go wrong with Berlin. This way of thinking led to quite a few misconceptions of what this beautiful city would be. Here they are:</span>\r\n<h2>Berlin is a European city, so it’s small.</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to remember my perspective here. I’m American, and we’re used to driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket and hours to the next state. It’s written into stone for us. When I moved to Berlin, I thought “finally, everything will be close.” I can jump on the S-Bahn and be in the city center in minutes. [City center in Berlin? That’s another post.] Laugh at me, because one of the first things I learned when I moved to Berlin, it’s freakin’ big. It take be 40 minutes to travel to my favorite coffee shop and bar. It takes 50 minutes to go to my boyfriend’s house, and 40 minutes to school. The best thing, I don’t have to drive anymore.</span><span style="text-align: center; background-color: #f8f8f8;"> </span><time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-03-31T08:09:41+00:00"></time>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2017/05/01/top-street-art-scenes-berlin-friedrichshain/">[READ: TOP STREET ART SCENES IN BERLIN FRIEDRICHSHAIN]</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="size-full wp-image-1222 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a>\r\n<h2>Germany’s cold in the winter, but it’s perfect in the summer.</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s pause as I laugh as myself just a bit. Warm in the summer? I can’t count how many Americans I told, “yes Berlin is like Michigan in the Summer.” Nope. Europe is a bit further north, and instead of beautiful sunshine in June and July, I’ve had wind, rain and chilly temperatures. Not so perfect.</span>\r\n<h2>Berlin’s international, so I won’t have to speak German.</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s every American’s misconception. Everyone speaks English in Germany, so I don’t have to try that hard. Nope. Several times I’ve had to clarify in German in the supermarket, or call Telecom DE to fix my telephone plan. Let’s just say I used simple German.</span><span style="text-align: center; background-color: #f8f8f8;"> </span>\r\n<h2>As long as I have a credit card, I’m fine.</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This needs a long ‘sigh.’ I believed that I could get by my first three months without opening a German bank account, but that’s a big misconception. It’s possible, but very inconvenient. Most prepaid telephone plans won’t go over a month without being connected to a SEPA deposit, the same with WLAN Wi-Fi connection and paying rent for your flat.</span>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/10/13/berlin-coffee-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">[READ: BERLIN COFFEE GUIDE]</span></a>\r\n<h2>It’d be easy to find a job.</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish this one was true, but I soon realized what a third-nation American meant in Germany. I was restricted on working hours, pay caps, and it just wasn’t nice. I felt like I had so many limitations, that employers simply didn’t want to hire me.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these few misconceptions, I’ve fallen in love with Berlin. It’s very vibrant, unique and a bit crazy. The people here are ‘real’, meaning that they stay true to themselves and live life. Yes, they’re a bit hippyish and hipster, but we all make Berlin into the place it’s suppose to be.</span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

When you walk this city, you’ll quickly realize the beautiful architecture that it hosts.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent two days in Riga, which was the perfect length of time. Being a small city, you don’t need to spend a long amount of time in the city. However, it does offer various museum tours, beer tours, charming walks and great restaurants. You won’t be bored.</span>\r\n<h2>Here is your quick guide…</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I flew to Riga, Latvia on the cheap airline <a href="http://www.ryanair.com">RyanAir</a>. For €40 and one hour flight, I was stepping off the plane in a new country. From the airport, the city is an easy 40 minute bus ride to the city center. It’s a <strong>cheap €1.20 bus ticket</strong> that can be purchased in the tourism office of the airport. Once you jump off the bus in the city center, you have<strong> complete access to the old town of Riga</strong>. In the morning, walk the cobblestone streets taking the views and snapping pictures of the beautiful pastel buildings. It takes you a quick 10 minute walk from one side of the city to the other, so take your time. On your walk, visit the buildings called <strong>“Three Brothers.”</strong> Here you can have a coffee at the most romantic cafe in Riga, listen to local musicians entertain the tourists and people watch. Nearby you will find several churches that you can take a quick walk around and enjoy a moment of silence.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For lunch, head to <strong>the old city walls</strong> where you will find several options for local and not so local food. Treat yourself, because I found a great dish of pasta to be €6 and a dish of chicken and potatoes for the same price. You must <strong>add the glass of wine or beer</strong>, because why not? It is cheap in Latvia. The <strong>Bastejkalns Park</strong> is the perfect place to relax in the sun and digest your food after lunch.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the afternoon, escape to the <strong>Museum of the Occupation of Latvia</strong> for a glimpse into the last several years of Latvia occupation. From Nazis to Soviets, the museum offers a very real and open interpretation of this time in Latvia history. In the summer, I suggest sitting in the city squares and enjoying a glass of something. I enjoyed watching the children play music on the street corner for money. They made a lot of money, and it was very cute. If you order sangria, please know that it will come in a litter. Riga Latvia is the <strong>perfect budget-friendly city</strong> that is easily accessible from Berlin, Germany. </span><b>Have you traveled to Latvia before?</b>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It’s a hot destination that remains to be on a traveler’s must do list. <strong>I highly believe in travel and cultural experiences</strong>, and a visit to Prague [short or quick] will give you just this. My visit to Prague was less than 24 hours, but I still enjoyed cultural tidbits and moments that will make your visit to this beautiful city complete. <span style="color: #ffffff;">A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE </span></span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1038" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29-5.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="682" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prague is the largest city, and the capital of the Czech Republic. Within a one hour walking tour, I quickly discovered Prague’s rich history from kings and queens to life behind the iron curtain. The history is wrapped around cobble stone roads, small markets and old, towering churches. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prague is unique, in that historically it escaped many of the WWII bombings, leaving it to be a rare gem in Eastern Europe. Throughout history, only a few of the buildings were destroyed leaving a perfect city testament to a long past history.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1033" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rsz_photo_apr_29-7.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="683" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I traveled to Prague on a night bus from Berlin, and then I traveled back on the same day of my arrival. It was a quick trip, but I found time exploring the major attractions and still enjoying rest time in cafes. Prague is very accessible by train, bus and plane from many major transportation hubs in Europe. <strong>FlixBus still remains to be my favorite and cheapest way to busabout Europe.</strong> </span>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/travel-essentials/">[Check out my other travel recommendations HERE.]</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="size-full wp-image-1222 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a short time in Prague, this is your day itinerary to this beautiful city.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1035" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29-6.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="683" />\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Morning in Prague</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tourist-heavy city, I suggest starting your morning as early as possible in Prague. It’s a tourist destination, and I saw more Germans in Prague, than I saw in Berlin. Because of this, start your day at the <strong>Charles Bridge</strong>. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1037" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29-4.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="682" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s known for its medieval architecture, ghostly statues and beautiful representation of historical Europe. It’s also a hustle spot for street arts, local artists and tourists. From here, cross the river to <strong>explore the local river bank and the Prague castle.</strong> The stony walls will tower over you, casting a romantic and medieval feeling upon you. If you find time, the castle is very beautiful and a nice couple hour tour. However once crossing the bridge, take in the sights from the <strong>old historic buildings lining the canals</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1039" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29-3.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="682" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a busy morning of walking, it’s time to treat yourself to a delicious cake and coffee. It’s cheap, cheap, cheap in Prague, so get the cake. It won’t hurt! The perfect spot to escape the city and enjoy is <strong>Cukrarna U knoflicku</strong>. The chocolate cake was amazing.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Afternoon in Prague</span></h2>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1040" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29-2.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="682" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can spend hours walking the side cobble stone streets of Prague, but walking the river was truly my favorite. A favorite place to walk was along the <strong>beautiful road Masarykovo nadr and escaping to the park island Slovansky ostrov.</strong> If you’re hungry, venture over to <strong>Havelska Koruna</strong> for an incredible CHEAP meal and delicious Czech food. I was in happy food heaven after eating at this place, and I even had a cheap beer to top it off. After lunch, catch the <strong>famous astronomical clock</strong> as it rings on the hour. </span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1036" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Photo-Apr-29.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="682" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">From here, walk the nearby <strong>Pražský poledník square</strong> to see beautiful pastel buildings and historic structures. Do you feel like a coffee, <strong>Coffee Lovers</strong> should be your next destination for an afternoon cappuccino.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1034" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rsz_photo_apr_29-8.jpg" alt="A QUICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE" width="1024" height="683" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prague holds countless memories and stories to be told. It’s rich history resonates throughout the streets, and it offers way more than a day has to give. These is a quick one day guide to Prague. If you find yourself with more time, wandering the side, small streets in the ancient city is delightful. <strong>What are your favorite attractions in Prague? (Pssst! Don\'t forget to pin this awesome article.)</strong></span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Urban. Unique. Vibrant. You can use these words to describe the unique photograph shots that my camera always seems to catch. The camera never drops from vibrant street art, and I know live in one of the most known cities in the world for it. Berlin. <strong>Berlin is crazy about street art</strong>. It’s in hidden alleyways. They have dedicated exhibits and communities for street art. There’s this underlying respect for this art form, that I’ve come to recognize and respect since moving to Berlin. We’re not talking graffiti here. We’re talking art. You can call it urban art. <span style="color: #ffffff;">TOP STREET ART SCENES IN BERLIN FRIEDRICHSHAIN</span>\r\n\r\n[bctt tweet="Berlin is crazy about street art." username=""]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1018" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Street art can be found everywhere in Berlin. You’ll see it in doorways, on walls, the side of trains, under bridges and on screens. You’ll be walking down a street, and [bam] your eye will catch a <strong>colorful art piece hidden</strong> [but not too hidden] from the world. You just have to be watching. Often these types of art pieces have a political message, but I have found the scenes in Berlin are more vibrant. You’ll find colorful murals of animals, robots and faces. It’s a way of expressing the unique spirit of Berlin - which sometimes can be political - in a nonverbal form. <strong>Berlin has much to say to the world.</strong> We just have to be listening with an open heart and an open mind. What do you think they’re saying? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to discover more about this exciting street art community. I teamed up with </span><a href="https://www.localguddy.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Guddy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berlin.snout/">Inish at Berlin.Snout</a> to <strong>discover COLOR in Friedrichshain.</strong> On a three-hour walking tour, the wonderful guide Inish toured me around hidden and known places in Friedrichshain. Her exciting stories and knowledge about the local community and the street artists never stopped. She was an unbelievable fountain of fruitful facts and information about this unique art medium. It was sweet to walk the streets with her, and learn about this new community.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1019" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2.jpg" alt="TOP STREET ART SCENES IN BERLIN FRIEDRICHSHAIN" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blues. Purple. Yellow. Green. Paper. The street art in this area took on many different forms, and through Inish’s guidance, I even began to recognize artists trends. I was jumping with joy asking questions about local artists and asking about hidden street art pieces. She was patient with my unique silliness, but very excited to share her knowledge and love for street art.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1020" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1021" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/4.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour not only provided insight into this art community, but also the <strong>vibrant community of Friedrichshain</strong>. You need to think cafes, art studios, bright colors, fun characters and a chill, chill environment. This is a community that you need to discover when in Berlin, and it’s on my radar as a next home destination. Summertime in this community will be rocking.</span>\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1023" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/7.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1024" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/8.jpg" alt="TOP STREET ART SCENES IN BERLIN FRIEDRICHSHAIN" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a local or passing through, the street art tour with Inish is a must do. It’s the perfect afternoon and gives you a small glimpse into WHY we love Berlin as much as we do. We adore her. Our Berlin. While in Friedrichshain, make sure to check out one of my favorite coffee houses called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silocoffee/">Silo Coffee</a>.<strong> Have you ever taken a street art tour?</strong></span>\r\n\r\n--- Thank you <a href="https://www.localguddy.com">Local Guddy</a> and Inish for sponsoring this wonderful afternoon in Berlin.

It’ll be warm and beautiful one week, and then the next, it will be cold and rainy. It feels like February, not April. You know the weather is crazy, when the Germans start to complain about it.<span style="color: #ffffff;"> </span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the weather being bipolar, I have the travel bug. That should be no surprise, and I’ve been <strong>discovering Germany one beautiful city at a time</strong>. Recently, this adventurous bug took me to the beautiful city of Leipzig. Living in Berlin has provided me with the perfect central hub to multiple cities around northern and eastern europe. <a href="https://www.flixbus.com"><strong>FlixBus is my goto transportation for affordable and comfortable travel around Germany.</strong></a> I’ve used them several, several times. You could say that I’m pretty much in love with them. From Berlin to Leipzig, it was a perfect two hour drive for as little as €10 one-way. They dropped me off close to the central station and within minutes I was walking around the historic old town of Leipzig.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a blast planning <strong>a short mini-trip to Leipzig</strong>. On this trip, it was my goal to <strong>visit alternative places that weren’t very touristy</strong>, and they truly <strong>reflected the heart and soul of Leipzig</strong>. It was a hefty goal for one day, but I believe it turned out pretty well. This is your one day itinerary to Leipzig.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning in Leipzig</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend your morning walking the old town of Leipzig. It is here where you’ll find beautiful old buildings, with a unique mixture of the old and new. Leipzig’s streets and buildings reflect a diverse past. After you have your morning coffee, walk to <strong>MarketPlatz</strong> and take in the view. </span>This vibrant and open space hosts colorful buildings with unique architecture. If you fancy a meal, this is a convenient place to find something quick or slow. It’s your choice.\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">From MarketPlatz, it’s worth a short walk through <strong>Mädler-Passage</strong>. This is a bright, glass domed passage that is the entrance to a variety of shops and restaurants. The view is simply unique, and it’s a fun place for a quick walk through. Next stop is the <strong>Thomaskirche</strong>, which is the resident church of J. S. Bach and his famed boy choir.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t find him today, but if you’re lucky, you might hear the church organist practicing in the middle of the day. Escape the chilly air and sit in this beautiful gothic church, taking in the views. If you fancy Bach, the <strong>Bach-Museum Leipzig</strong> is a great introduction to this famed composer. Avoid Mondays, because usually Germany museums are closed. Taking the alternate route, the next stop takes you into the afternoon.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afternoon in Leipzig</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I visit a city, I try to catch a glimpse of ordinary and everyday life. In Leipzig, it was my goal to find this while walking along <strong>Gottschedstraße</strong>. Here the streets were quieter, and locals ran from place to place. The buildings were beautiful white and pastel. Every few buildings had a unique gold decorative outdoor furnishing. Perfect for a photography snap. This short walk brings you to a fancy little cafe for coffee. It is called <strong>Café Fleischerei.</strong> </span>\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This cafe is situated in an old meat store, which is kind of unique in itself. Because of this, the ceiling has beautiful colors and unique designs. The hot chocolate was pretty good, and it was a nice rest place. Can I say free wifi? This is where you’ll update your Instagram and snapchat. Still looking for quiet and beautiful streets, the afternoon walk led me to <strong>Hinrichsenstraße</strong>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could add an ice cream shop to the list, this would be a perfect afternoon.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was your short and alternative guide to Leipzig, Germany. It’s the perfect one day destination with <a href="https://www.flixbus.com">FlixBus from Berlin</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Do you ever feel those days? The rain looks cold and little dreary, and it’s currently keeping me from wanting to go explore. However, it’s put me into a rather reflective mood. I have my coffee, and these types are moods are perfect when I can combine both weather, coffee and these feelings. So, you might be wondering, what the heck am I going to do with these feelings? I feel like dreaming and planning, so <strong>this post is going to bring you my things to do before I turn 30. </strong></span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My personality goes something like this: analytical, structured, creative and introverted. Introversion might be the direct reason I have no problem staying home all day drinking coffee and writing. It’s what fuels my spirit, and it rejuvenates my creativity. I also love to plan, and I’ve been able to conquer so many things in life [so far] because I’ve never feared dreaming and doing. What better way to start this post than state what I’ve already accomplished. I want to share my excitement for the many wonderful goals that I have already accomplished and currently living. Here we go: </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>[1] I moved abroad.</strong> It’s been my dream for years to have the experience to live in another country. I knew it would challenge me in new ways, and I’d discover the aspects of myself that I never thought of before. So, I live in Berlin, and I’m studying my masters. Which brings me to number 2.</span>\r\n[fusion_content_boxes layout="clean-horizontal" columns="1" title_size="" title_color="" body_color="" backgroundcolor="" iconcolor="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_radius="" circlecolor="" circlebordersize="" circlebordercolor="" outercirclebordersize="" outercirclebordercolor="" icon_size="" icon_hover_type="" hover_accent_color="" link_type="" link_area="" link_target="" icon_align="left" animation_type="" animation_delay="" animation_offset="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" margin_top="" margin_bottom="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id=""][fusion_content_box title="I MOVED ABROAD TO STUDY AND TRAVEL THE WORLD" backgroundcolor="" icon="fa-plane" iconflip="" iconrotate="" iconspin="no" iconcolor="" circlecolor="" circlebordersize="" circlebordercolor="" outercirclebordersize="" outercirclebordercolor="" image="" image_width="35" image_height="35" link="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2017/01/19/i-moved-abroad-to-study-and-travel-the-world/" linktext="Read More" link_target="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""][/fusion_content_box][/fusion_content_boxes]\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>[2] Currently conquering a master program in business.</strong> Here I am. I’m ultimately fulfilling two dreams at once, by getting my masters in Leadership and Management. It’s hard, but it’s so exciting to see the opportunities that are emerging from this experience. Then, there’s the reason for this blog.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>[3] I have an unbelievable craving for travel and adventure, and I’m in living in a major hub of Europe.</strong> Upcoming adventures include Riga, Latvia, Prague, Czech and Poznan, Poland. Will you follow along?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can say, currently, I’m soaking in these three goals and enjoying every moment of them. Everyday, I remind myself how lucky I am to be discovering this beautiful continent and fulfilling my dreams. Let’s take a breather for a second and announce something epic. I’m turning 25 years old in two months. At the end of June, I would have passed a quarter of my life, and I’m happy to say, I’m impressed with what I did with it. I traveled solo to multiple countries. I got my first degree.  I lived in multiple places. I began my career. Now, <strong>let’s look forward to the next 5 years.</strong> What should I do with them? I’d say enjoy, live and be happy, but let’s be more specific than that.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">TRAVEL NORTH AMERICA</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve traveled the Americas extensively, but not enough. It’s crazy huge, and I look forward to <strong>planning road trips across the country. </strong></span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">GO SOMEWHERE EXOTIC</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, I’ve traveled and stayed in comfy hotel and hostel rooms. I’m looking for an <strong>epic experience</strong> that will take me to unknown regions, somewhere the typical tourist doesn’t go and somewhere that feels like the end of the earth. The Arctic. </span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND DANCE</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never been to a disco club. This is an experience that I feel every 20 something needs to at least experience once. It might be once, but I can say that I did it.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">CONQUER THE GERMAN LANGUAGE AND LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I said conquer it, and I have a long way to go. I want to <strong>be fluent in German within the next two years</strong>, and I believe it’s a goal that I can achieve. Once I conquer German, maybe I’ll move to Spanish.</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">DO THESE ADRENALINE SPORTS: WHITE WATER RAFTING, BUNGEE JUMP &amp; SKYDIVE </span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m pretty uneasy with heights and waters, so I plan to <strong>push myself outside of my comfort zone.</strong></span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BECOME AN EXPERT IN THE MARKETING FIELD</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, my experience in marketing has been very broad and generic. This was great for my early career, because it encouraged me to try everything. However, now I’m entering the next stage of my career, and <strong>I want to become an expert</strong>. I want to be that “goto” person. I’m thinking an expert in inbound marketing and email marketing. I also wish to continue to develop my writing, social media and design skills. I never want to say “no I can’t do that.”</span>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BECOME FINANCIALLY AND LOCATION INDEPENDENT</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These two goals ultimately go together, because I want to learn how to <strong>live minimal</strong>. This means no 30 pairs of shoes, no big house and debt. I want to live within my means, and learn to seek experiences not stuff. This will make me location independent, meaning I want to feel like I can ‘pick up and go’ anywhere I want. I’m never boxed. I’m never limited.</span>\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BS3wvFBA8h0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Berlin, Travel + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-04-14T15:45:26+00:00">Apr 14, 2017 at 8:45am PDT</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BECOME A WINE EXPERT</span></h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, a snob.

When we dream of exploring the world, money becomes a quick reality checker. I\'ve learned from experience, traveling is just as enjoyable on a large budget as on a small budget. Each experience brings something unique and memorable to the experience. However, what if I could tell you that <strong>you can have a unique and memorable experience on a next-to-nothing budget.</strong> It’s possible. If you\'re a native english speaker, I have the perfect solution for your next trip abroad. <span style="color: #ffffff;">FOUR COUNTRIES YOU CAN EXPLORE FOR FREE</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple. Becoming more popular, english immersion programs can be found across Europe, providing you with the opportunity to <strong>travel abroad cheap and engage in cross-cultural experiences</strong>. The monetary contribution on your side is the round trip airplane ticket, and the accommodation before and after the program. During the program, your transportation, accommodation and food is completely paid for. Does that sound pretty good? If that doesn’t convince you, the experience opens doors for <strong>new travel experiences</strong>. You’ll engage with individuals across cultures, share meaningful conversations and joke about cultural stereotypes. My past experiences have been perfect for fueling my personal search for meaningful travel. [<a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/11/14/personal-search-meaningful-travel/">You can read more about that here.</a>]</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are four countries that you can visit through English immersion programs:</span>\r\n<h2>Germany</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the land of bratwurst and beer. Through the <a href="http://www.diverbo.com">Diverbo</a> EnglischHausen program, you will experience a week in several resorts around Germany enjoying nature, amazing food and great beer. The German culture is intuitive and meaningful, especially after a week of intensive interaction. I have done this program once in the beautiful mountains of south Germany. I left the experience with new friends, meaningful connections and stories. I also enjoyed exploring a local castle and walking the green forests.</span>\r\n<h2>Spain</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also with <a href="http://www.diverbo.com">Diverbo</a>, experience another side of <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2017/03/04/my-experience-with-diverbo-pueblo-ingles/">Spain with the PuebloIngles program</a>. Again, you will have several venues to choose from, and each experience will be unique. With this program, escape into the northern mountains of Spain and interact with smiling, lively and hilarious Spaniards. You’ll experience plenty of hilarious jokes and cultural moments. Don’t forget to ask for a coffee with milk, not a cappuccino.</span>\r\n<h2>Italy</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.speakinitaly.com">SPEAK</a> is new program on my radar, but I’m equally excited about it. The structure of the program appears very similar to Diverbo, but with this program, you can escape into the hills of Tuscany and sip Italian wine. I believe that is good enough reason to apply. </span>\r\n<h2>Poland</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland has been on my travel list for the last year for several reasons. It’s culturally diverse, the landscape is beautiful and it’s relatively “unknown” by the rest of Europe. Does it sound like a good escape? <a href="http://angloville.com/teach-english/">The Angloville program</a> provides a much larger experience with programs for adults, children and young teens. The summer months are particularly busy, offering many opportunities to enjoy the culture and food of Poland.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Attending one of these programs is the perfect way to explore a new country on a budget, experience a new travel moment and walk away with lifelong memories. I’m already trying to work these four programs into my 2017 and 2018 travel plans, and I think you should try to also. If you’re still not convinced, read this detailed blog post I wrote about my experience with PeubloIngles. <strong>Have you ever done a program like this?</strong></span>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Until recently [I believe], East London wasn’t the place to be. Whatever the reason was, as you walk the water canal and streets now, you feel a new, vibrant community emerging from the shadows. People of all ages are wandering, and an old, rustic historical atmosphere is painted. The streets are fairly quiet, and most of the buildings have a home feel. The tube connects you to all other parts of London, so you never feel unconnected from the city life. <span style="color: #ffffff;">EXPLORING EAST LONDON ON A SUNDAY MORNING</span>\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRVSZQ9geeK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-03-07T09:54:44+00:00">Mar 7, 2017 at 1:54am PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nOn that bright, sunny Sunday morning, I decided to venture out to discover the famed East London coffee houses and markets. I stayed in an Airbnb near the Mile End tube stop, which after walking, it seemed to be on the far east side of where I wanted to mainly explore. However, the walk on that Sunday morning took me by a canal [what, canals in London?]. I never imaged finding a canal. I suppose it makes since, but <strong>it proved to be a wonderful surprise and stroll in the morning light.</strong> From here, I continued north.\r\n\r\nDuring my short time in East London, <strong>I discovered two coffee houses that were small, adorable and perfect to my liking.</strong> The first was run by a pair of ladies with a cute humor and delicious cakes. The shop was located near the Mile End tube stop, which provided a great view out of a window to people watch. This little place was called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecoffeeroom.london/">The Coffee Room</a>. <strong>I was the only one that morning having my coffee as NOT take away</strong>. The second coffee house was discovered after an hour running in circles, my phone dying and looking for a different coffee house. I was actually suppose to meet a friend, which made the whole situation a bit embarrassing. Besides, the event encouraged me to walk into a tiny, tiny coffee house with two great baristas. They even let me charge my phone with their own charger, which I considered a huge plus. I was no longer lost, and I had a map! This lovely place was called <strong>Holy Shot Coffee</strong>, and their chocolate croissant with a cappuccino hit the hunger spot.\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRK2aDpAxb3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-03-03T08:37:46+00:00">Mar 3, 2017 at 12:37am PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nAfter I was fueled on cappuccinos and chocolate croissants, I decided to search for the <strong>Columbia Road Flower market</strong>. In no time, I found it, because the steady stream of people seemed to only go in one direction. The people carry flowers around was a dead giveaway. It was a little suffocating with the amount of people walking around the market, but it was well worth a visit, even once. It was a small market, but a fantastic place to take in the colorful views. The tulips were particularly beautiful, and I had to do everything to stop myself from buying a bundle. I don’t think that would’ve lasted on the plane to Berlin. Spring is coming with great opportunities for fresh flowers. The next market I ran into was by chance. It was called <strong>Broadway Market</strong>. I literally stumbled upon it, but it was a fantastic find. <strong>The vintage apparel was in abundance, and I had to do everything to pull myself away from the vintage cameras.</strong> I would have my entire room in Berlin lined with those beautiful cameras. The market also offered superb street food, and fansinating street art around every corner. The area has music bouncing off the walls, and people were dancing in the streets. This photographer was snapping away at the colorful graffiti. Should I even call it graffiti? It was artwork.\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRECreIg0IJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-02-28T17:10:19+00:00">Feb 28, 2017 at 9:10am PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRDDeTSgxxJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-02-28T07:58:01+00:00">Feb 27, 2017 at 11:58pm PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nThat was a short, sweet guide to a lovely Sunday morning in East London.

It seems a bit impossible actually. These are the feelings that I have regarding my time at the <a href="http://www.diverbo.com">Diverbo Global Pueblo Ingles program</a> [or Diverbo] in Spain. What is the Diverbo program? It’s a language exchange program between native Spanish professionals and English professionals. For one week, I was socializing, interacting, laughing and building relationships with a fantastic group of individuals from Spain and around the world. What did I take from the experience? I took a heightened positive view of the world and lasting relationships.\r\n\r\nI found the program in a humorous and silly way. If you’ve been interacting on the blog, you know that I’ve been searching for a <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2017/01/14/this-is-the-year-of-meaningful-travel/">more meaningful travel experience</a>. I wasn’t quite sure what I was searching for, but after this program, I know. My search for meaning travel translated nicely into the set up at Diverbo. I made meaningful connections with people. I was no longer a tourist, and I saw a part of Spain that an American would normally not. That was pretty special in itself.\r\n\r\n[bctt tweet="My search for meaning travel translated nicely into the set up at Diverbo." username=""]\r\n\r\nThe program was pretty inclusive. It was 10 days in a beautiful town in north, west Spain called La Alberca. It’s a town of about 3,000 yearly residences, so there was by no means a Walmart superstore around the corner. It was quiet adorable, and offered a unique perspective on the Spanish lifestyle. It was also a very historic town, being a stop on the El Camino and a major stop dating back to the Crusades. That was an interesting piece of historical information. It deserves a google search, because I can by no means explain the historical significance of this little town in one blog post.\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ5KL61AXHP/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-02-24T11:44:16+00:00">Feb 24, 2017 at 3:44am PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nWhat did we do? We talked, talked and talked more. I never stoped talking. The program was all inclusive, meaning our food and boarding was paid for. The only thing that was not included was the plane ticket. Since I had preplanned to come to Europe, it worked out very nicely making a detour to Spain for a week. The program started at 9:00am and ended after 10:00pm. Can we say LONG day? The mornings consisted of breakfast with the native Spanish speakers, encouraging them to speak and have small talk. Practice, practice, practice. Then we broke out into small one-on-one interactions. For about three hours, we spent 50 minutes with each student talking about funky english idioms, sayings and just talking. Have you ever tried to explain a common phrase you use every day? Like for example: “that was a piece of cake” or “the cat is out of the bag.” It sounds crazy, but those were the phrases that we had to explain to our native Spanish speakers. The more I explained these phrases, the more I wandered why we actually use these silly sayings. We’d have lunch Spanish time around 2:00pm. Let’s just say the food was amazing. I have never had such delicious three course meals in one week. It was everything from pasta, to duck, fish and chicken. It was just amazing, and this cheap college student was eating like an elephant. I’m still living on those calories. Lunch ended and we had about two/three hours of free time. The free time always seemed to disappear too quickly, and I usually made my way back to my room and fell asleep. The rooms were also cozy, clean and superb. The evening brought music performances, skits, plays and presentations. It was a blast to see such support by all of us for our students. Every time, a student had a loud applause. We constantly supported and positively praised people.\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ315PmAChX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-02-23T23:27:43+00:00">Feb 23, 2017 at 3:27pm PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nI can talk all day about how wonderful the students and fellow teachers were. They were superb, and I enjoyed getting to know each one of them. They each had an interesting story and life experience that I enjoyed listening and soaking into my soul. I can’t forget the program leaders, because they honestly made the whole program happen. They never seemed to sleep, but their constant positivity and hard work was seen and reflected through out the program week.\r\n\r\nI believe I received just as much of a positive experience from this program as my students. Each of my students were incredible insightful, intelligent and caring. I had students helping me with my relationship problems, telling me that I had plenty of time to find someone. I had one student helping me prepare a Spanish song to perform on my flute. I had a student help me brainstorm ideas for a career in management. It was amazing the amount of life experience, professional experience, support and positive influence these individuals had for me. I’ll never forget their kind words, their support and listening ears. Yes, they helped me just as much as I helped them. I can’t wait to have another fantastic experience in a future program.\r\n<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">\r\n<div style="padding: 8px;">\r\n<div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div>\r\n<p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ_NvUTAnJ-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post shared by MEGAN | Blogger + Expat (@hellomeganmarie)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2017-02-26T20:10:46+00:00">Feb 26, 2017 at 12:10pm PST</time></p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>\r\n\r\nThe program is constantly looking for native english speakers from all backgrounds and walks of life. I encourage you to apply, and I hope you have just as positive of a experience as I did. I’d get a good night sleep the night before, because you take off running. However, it will be a wonderful experience that you will never forget. <strong>Have you completed a similar program?</strong>[/fusion_text][fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="642" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://eepurl.com/codE4P" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/travel-planner.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="604" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://theartisticbrunette.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=79a225adf8" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/travel-ebook.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="603" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://eepurl.com/cnP4wv" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free-Travel-Guide.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][/fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_person name="" title="" picture="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Megan-Banner.jpg" pic_link="" linktarget="_self" pic_style="glow" hover_type="none" background_color="" content_alignment="" pic_style_color="" pic_bordersize="" pic_bordercolor="" pic_borderradius="" icon_position="" social_icon_boxed="" social_icon_boxed_radius="" social_icon_color_type="" social_icon_colors="" social_icon_boxed_colors="" social_icon_tooltip="" blogger="" deviantart="" digg="" dribbble="" dropbox="" facebook="" flickr="" forrst="" googleplus="" instagram="" linkedin="" myspace="" paypal="" pinterest="" reddit="" rss="" skype="" soundcloud="" spotify="" tumblr="" twitter="" vimeo="" vk="" xing="" yahoo="" yelp="" youtube="" email="" show_custom="no" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

It was like a dream [literally] as I skipped around Southern California, having loads of coffee and hiking. I lived in California for 10 years, but that doesn\'t mean this wonderful area doesn\'t hold new adventures. My best friend and I had a magical Saturday in Long Beach exploring abandon places and sipping coffee. Yes, I took her to two coffee shops. [More on that coffee shop later.] However, the highlight of that day was exploring Sunken City Landslide in Long Beach/San Pedro.\r\n\r\n<img class="size-full wp-image-857 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-08-at-11.56.37-AM.png" alt="" width="457" height="263" />\r\n\r\nThis interesting spot was actually part of a neighborhood at one point. Well between erosion and everything else, it literally fell of the side of a cliff into the ocean. Now it\'s a perfect place to explore [illegally] and take fun photographs.\r\n\r\nIt\'s always fun meeting people on these small adventures. It was a Saturday morning, so the area was bustling. I met many other travel bloggers in the Southern California area, snapping away.\r\n\r\nWe had to walk around a bit to find the best location to jump the fence. Yes, I said it. We jumped a fence. The best place to hop was near the Point Fermin park. It wasn\'t legal or [quit] safe, so make sure to be careful.\r\n\r\nOnce [under] the fence, we walked up and down a few hills and found ourselves in the middle of this interesting place. It was interesting seeing the old concrete from the streets, jagged and sticking up from the ground. Old and expensive palm trees in the middle of a concrete slab once marked the side of a street corner. How interesting is that?\r\n\r\n[bctt tweet="It was interesting seeing the old concrete from the streets, jagged and sticking up from the ground." username=""]\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-858" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6938.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6947.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" />\r\n\r\nMake sure to always grab a friend to explore abandon places.

If you\'re looking for a fun one hour excursion in the Los Angeles area, Sunken City is the place to explore. I become a little bit braver every time I visit a place like this. I\'m slowly working myself up for when I go off exploring in Eastern Germany. I know there are a few amazing places. However, the German police scare me way more than American police. Loads of courage. Don\'t forget to pin the pictures if you liked reading this post. <strong>Have you ever explored an abandon place? </strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

Cheap. I’m pretty much broke as a new master student and coordinating all my travels to move abroad. Because of this, traveling by the cheapest means was at the forefront of my mind. <span style="color: #ffffff;">HOW I BOOKED A $220 FLIGHT TO LONDON, ENGLAND</span>\r\n\r\nTo find this deal, I used patience, my flight hacks, flexibility and patience. I emphasize patience, because I searched for weeks checking different times and trying different websites. Through the process, I discovered several cheap airlines flying from Florida [where I live] to Europe. These cheap airlines included Norwegian and EuroWings.\r\n\r\nPreviously I traveled with EuroWings on my flight from Germany to Florida. It was a budget airline, but honestly, it was affordable, comfortable with excellent German efficiency and service. I had no complaints here.\r\n\r\nThis time on the way back to Europe, I booked with Norwegian, which is doing very affordable plane tickets connecting through London, England. I knew I only had to travel to London, England, and from there I could jump on a cheap, budget airline to anywhere in Europe. It was all starting to shape up. In the end, I booked a very affordable ticket to Europe. [I even believe I could’ve found a cheaper one, if I searched longer and harder.] When you look for your own affordable flight to Europe, keep these few things in mind.\r\n\r\n[bctt tweet="When you look for your own affordable flight to Europe, keep these few things in mind." username="@hellomeganmarie"]\r\n<h1>1 //</h1>\r\nBeing flexible with your flight options will usually lead to better deals. This flexibility involves travel dates, times and airports. On my way to London, I’m flying through Gatwick, not London Heathrow. It’s a little bit further outside of London, but it offers fantastic [and affordable] connections to the city center. Furthermore, many budget airlines only fly on certain days of the weeks. If you can organize your flight schedule to flying out on a Wednesday and coming home on a Thursday, you will find better options.\r\n<h1>2 //</h1>\r\nResearch multiple flight websites for the best price, wait for the perfect moment and book on the airline website. Booking on search websites is okay, but I prefer to leave my chances with the airline.\r\n<h1>3 //</h1>\r\nFly with minimal luggage. This is where the budget airlines snag you, but for the $50 upgrade I still find it cheaper than most major airlines. On my way from Germany, I traveled on EuroWings for $250, which included dinner, seat reservation and luggage hold. It’s up to your comfort level, but if I’m going for a short one or two week trip, I will fly “bare” and take carry-on luggage only.\r\n<h1>4 //</h1>\r\nConsider booking multiple one way tickets when the price is cheaper. This option will take a bit more research and coordination on your part, but it can prove a couple $100 in savings. You can consider flying straight to a major European hub, but then connecting with another airline [with a separate ticket] to your final destination.\r\n\r\nIf you’re still wandering how the heck I snagged this great deal, make sure to read my other blog post about fantastic <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/10/05/my-ultimate-travel-flight-hacks/">FLIGHT HACKS</a>. With the emergence of these new budget airlines, travel seems more affordable and obtainable than ever before. Take advantage of the moment [before it disappears] and visit a place you’ve never been. <strong>What is the cheapest flight you’ve ever found?</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="642" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://eepurl.com/codE4P" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/travel-planner.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="604" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://theartisticbrunette.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=79a225adf8" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/travel-ebook.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_code]Jmx0O2NlbnRlciZndDsmbHQ7YSBocmVmPSZxdW90O2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuYW5yZG9lenJzLm5ldC9jbGljay04MjAxOTg3LTEyNzMxOTgxLTE0Nzg1NDc0NzUwMDAmcXVvdDsmZ3Q7CiZsdDtpbWcgc3JjPSZxdW90O2h0dHA6Ly93d3cubGR1aHRycC5uZXQvaW1hZ2UtODIwMTk4Ny0xMjczMTk4MS0xNDc4NTQ3NDc1MDAwJnF1b3Q7IHdpZHRoPSZxdW90OzE4MCZxdW90OyBoZWlnaHQ9JnF1b3Q7MTUwJnF1b3Q7IGFsdD0mcXVvdDtKdXN0Zmx5LmNvbSZxdW90OyBib3JkZXI9JnF1b3Q7MCZxdW90Oy8mZ3Q7Jmx0Oy9hJmd0OyZsdDsvY2VudGVyJmd0Ow==[/fusion_code][/fusion_builder_column_inner][/fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_person name="" title="" picture="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Megan-Banner.jpg" pic_link="" linktarget="_self" pic_style="glow" hover_type="none" background_color="" content_alignment="" pic_style_color="" pic_bordersize="" pic_bordercolor="" pic_borderradius="" icon_position="" social_icon_boxed="" social_icon_boxed_radius="" social_icon_color_type="" social_icon_colors="" social_icon_boxed_colors="" social_icon_tooltip="" blogger="" deviantart="" digg="" dribbble="" dropbox="" facebook="" flickr="" forrst="" googleplus="" instagram="" linkedin="" myspace="" paypal="" pinterest="" reddit="" rss="" skype="" soundcloud="" spotify="" tumblr="" twitter="" vimeo="" vk="" xing="" yahoo="" yelp="" youtube="" email="" show_custom="no" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

We know where Starbucks is located in the major airports around the world, checking into a hostel is a breeze and we make new travel friends in minutes. We are the frequent travelers. However, people like us usually live out of a suitcase. We own at least two sturdy suitcases, a camera bag, backpack and all our childhood possessions are sitting in the attic in our parent’s house. For a traveler that strays away from physical possessions [like me], Christmas can be a HASSLE for relatives. Don’t worry, I have you covered! <span style="color: #ffffff;">THE ULTIMATE GIFT GUIDE FOR THE FREQUENT TRAVELER</span>\r\n\r\nI currently have two suitcases sitting in my closet. Every time I go shopping, I think of one article of clothing I can give away. It’s a constant give and take process, because every additional suitcase costs $100+ to fly. Do you agree frequent travelers and expats? When gifting for the frequent traveler, think small, light and digital.\r\n<h2>1 // AMAZON GIFT CARD</h2>\r\nI’m personally obsessed with Amazon. It has everything that I want. It has camera bags, purses and digital eBooks. For those long airplane flights, purchase a few Amazon gift cards to give the gift of reading. <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/travel-essentials/">Find more Amazon presents HERE.</a>\r\n<h2>2 // SPOTIFY SUBSCRIPTION</h2>\r\nI love music and spotify is amazing. However, I’m also super cheap, because I’m pulling pennies together for travel expenses. <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/gift-card/">So gifting a year subscription to Spotify would make an amazing gift.</a>\r\n<h2>3 // AIRBNB GIFT CARD</h2>\r\nI would be overjoyed to receive a present like this, because we [as travelers] spent oodles of money on accommodation. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/gift/send?ref=p1_promo">Gift an Airbnb gift card to make that traveler happy.</a>\r\n<h2>4 // CREATE A PHOTO BOOK</h2>\r\nAs travelers, we take thousands and thousands of incredible pictures. What better way to encourage us to share those photos, but by gifting a photo book. <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/photo-books">Shutterfly offers fantastic options of designs and sizes.</a>\r\n<h2>5 // SUBSCRIPTION TO A TRAVEL MAGAZINE</h2>\r\nYou have several to choose from including Conde Nast Traveler, National Geographic and more! This would be such a fun and great gift to a traveler that spends many hours on the airplane and in airports. Make sure to purchase the digital option!\r\n\r\nChristmas gifting for the frequent traveler can be difficult, but I hope these five options spark a gift idea. Traveling with a load of stuff can be difficult, so keeping it simple and light is always best. These are the type of gifts that I am looking for this Christmas, and I’ll be excited to check my Christmas stocking next week. Merry Christmas! <strong>What are your gift ideas?</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

We cross off countries like it’s a working formula. We breeze down Italian cobblestone roads, because well, we’ve done it several times. We don’t think twice about introducing ourselves to that foreign guy, because well, we’ve done it a million times. Traveling, like any hobby or new skill, becomes better with practice. We become quicker on our feet, we find the <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/10/05/my-ultimate-travel-flight-hacks/">best priced plane tickets</a> and we become more confident. <span style="color: #ffffff;">CELEBRATE YOUR TRAVEL ACCOMPLISHMENTS</span>\r\n\r\nHowever, have we ever stopped to think about how AMAZING our <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/blog/">travel accomplishments</a> really are. Some of us have marked off 50+ countries and lived abroad for multiple years. Some of us make money blogging full-time. These are amazing travel accomplishments that a majority of the population of the world only dreams. It only stays a dream for them. We are the dreamers, but we are also the achievers. We achieve our dreams.\r\n\r\nI’m constantly reminded of how lucky I am to have traveled when I visit home. I’ve been working in a coffee shop for the last month to save money for more travels. I work with young people under 21 years old. As I pour out my travel stories, their eyes get bigger and bigger. I often hear words like: “I wish” and I want to”. I hope my travel stories will inspire them to discover new countries and think more global.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up this thought, this holiday season think about your travel accomplishments and celebrate them. Share them with others. Inspire others to seek the same travel dreams that you have accomplished. <strong>Share your travel accomplishment in the comments, and I will share on social media.\f</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="642" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://eepurl.com/codE4P" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/travel-planner.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="604" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://theartisticbrunette.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=79a225adf8" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/travel-ebook.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][fusion_builder_column_inner type="1_3" layout="1_3" spacing="" center_content="no" hover_type="none" link="" min_height="" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" background_color="" background_image="" background_position="left top" background_repeat="no-repeat" border_size="0" border_color="" border_style="solid" padding="" dimension_margin="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset="" last="no" border_position="all"][fusion_imageframe image_id="603" style_type="none" stylecolor="" hover_type="none" bordersize="" bordercolor="" borderradius="" align="none" lightbox="no" gallery_id="" lightbox_image="" alt="" link="http://eepurl.com/cnP4wv" linktarget="_self" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" animation_type="" animation_direction="left" animation_speed="0.3" animation_offset=""]http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Free-Travel-Guide.jpg[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column_inner][/fusion_builder_row_inner][fusion_person name="" title="" picture="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Megan-Banner.jpg" pic_link="" linktarget="_self" pic_style="glow" hover_type="none" background_color="" content_alignment="" pic_style_color="" pic_bordersize="" pic_bordercolor="" pic_borderradius="" icon_position="" social_icon_boxed="" social_icon_boxed_radius="" social_icon_color_type="" social_icon_colors="" social_icon_boxed_colors="" social_icon_tooltip="" blogger="" deviantart="" digg="" dribbble="" dropbox="" facebook="" flickr="" forrst="" googleplus="" instagram="" linkedin="" myspace="" paypal="" pinterest="" reddit="" rss="" skype="" soundcloud="" spotify="" tumblr="" twitter="" vimeo="" vk="" xing="" yahoo="" yelp="" youtube="" email="" show_custom="no" hide_on_mobile="small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility" class="" id="" /][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

I have been working on this project since August. During my time in Austria, I developed the insane idea to write a travel memoir about my first solo travel experience to New Zealand.

I will forever be reflecting on this first solo travel experience, but I feel that this memoir truly captures the struggles and life lessons I gained during this experience.

I was on my way to work thinking a million and one thoughts. This always happens to me. Then suddenly, I gasped and realized I’ll be turning 25 this summer. Even to this second, I keep second guessing myself. Am I really turning 25? Well, yes you are Megan, and it’s time to think about how you’re going to end this quarter section of your life. With a bang? With a thrill? I had to calculate my age on my phone, because I still can’t believe it. So, this blog post is me facing a small quarter life transition.\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1222" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn my 25 years of life, I have seen plenty of magical places, challenged myself in new ways and simply done things that I never imagined I would. Many times, I forget what I have accomplished, then I am introduced to a new person and all these stories resurface. I have already traveled solo to 4 countries and traveled in general to 25 countries. My favorites are still <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/category/austria/">Austria</a>, <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/category/new-zealand/">New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/category/germany/">Germany</a>. I’ve also traveled around my own country [extensively], and went to a new city <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/11/03/philadelphia-coffee-guide/">[Philadelphia]</a> this last month. I’ve worked two full-time jobs in the field of marketing, and I am working on my masters in Leadership &amp; Management. I learned to snow ski last winter, and I’ve lived abroad [and will do this again]. I am learning a new language. So, what’s left for this year? Many things, because I still have 6 months to go until my birthday, and I have many adventures before then.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/11/14/personal-search-meaningful-travel/">Work on making travel more meaningful.</a></li>\r\n \t<li>Eat less red meat and more green every week.</li>\r\n \t<li>Learn how to make coffee and become a barista.</li>\r\n \t<li>Settle into a city and think about where ‘home’ truly is.</li>\r\n \t<li>Work on saying ‘NO’ to things that don’t make me happy.</li>\r\n \t<li>Encourage myself to be outdoors.</li>\r\n \t<li>Find a life and career mentor.</li>\r\n \t<li>Do one crazy thing: get a travel tattoo, bungee jump or skydive.</li>\r\n \t<li>Work on understanding myself, my emotions, my dreams and my loves.</li>\r\n \t<li>Live. Just live and love every second of it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYes, I have given myself vast goals. As I near this quarter transition, I mostly want to reflect on what I have already accomplished. As I mentioned, I have done much. In a society where checklists and bucket lists are [the norm], I want to encourage myself to step outside the boundaries and focus on the moment. I want to remember the memories that I have already created, and I want to encourage myself to make life more meaningful. Your turn. <strong>What are a few things YOU think I should do before I turn 25?</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

My host had graciously offered to share her lunch with me on a bright, sunny day in Berlin. I was freezing, because anything under 70 degrees F is cold for this California girl. She giggled at me, as I put boots, a sweater and pants on. The tasty lunch consisted of potato soup, German bread and watermelon. My German is minimal, but in between Google translate and smiling, we had a conversation. The wind ruffled my hair, and I smiled as we discussed her next travel destination, <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/category/new-zealand/">New Zealand</a>. You can always find a topic of similar interest, even if you have a language barrier. Within 15 minutes, we were done, and she continued on with her day. But I remember that moment.<span style="color: #ffffff;">MY PERSONAL SEARCH FOR MEANINGFUL TRAVEL</span>\r\n\r\nI enjoy traveling to new countries and visiting museums, seeing historic landmarks and awing at paintings. It’s part of the travel experience. However, I have recently begun to think how I can make my travel experiences more meaningful. Making travel meaningful will be different for everyone. For me, I’m still not sure, but I have faith that through my upcoming experiences, I will discover what meaningful travel means to me. Currently, I believe meaningful travel is sharing experiences with others, having engaging conversations with people from diverse backgrounds and experiencing the non tourist path. Once I experience more in life, I truly think this idea of meaningful travel will morph and evolve.\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="size-full wp-image-1222 alignleft" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs I plan my <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/2016/11/03/top-2017-travel-destinations/">2017 travel destinations</a>, I cannot help but think back to meaningful travel. This year will be an exciting year for me, because I will be moving to Berlin to study and begin my career abroad. I will be fulfilling my dream of living abroad, studying my masters and traveling. I know I will visit places like Amsterdam and London purely as a tourist, but I want to know how I can experience these places [and new places] in a more meaningful way. These are a few of my ideas, and I hope you will share yours in the comments.\r\n\r\nWhen I visit a new place, I will attempt to make the experience meaningful by...\r\n\r\n<strong>1 //</strong> Sitting in multiple coffee shops and people watching. I enjoy seeing how others live their lives differently, but also the same. One of the coziest ways to do this is by sitting in a coffee shop.\r\n\r\n<strong>2 //</strong> Volunteer for a couple of hours in a new city. If I find myself in a city for more than 48 hours, I would like to encourage myself to volunteer through a soup kitchen, music, street cleaning or anything that will engage others and spark conversation.\r\n\r\n<strong>3 // </strong>Plan at least one trip abroad that is focused on volunteerism and helping. The world offers so many options for this, and I’ve been researching them slowly. Some of them do not cost money, but instead are paid by donations or a corporate company. For example, I am looking into a English conversation program in south Spain, where I can talk and engage with the locals, while they practice English. That to me will make my experience more meaningful.\r\n\r\n<strong>4 // </strong>Research, work with and buy from companies that are focused on a good cause. This could be anything, but I am particularly thinking about Stray Bus Tours in New Zealand. During our trip, we had the option to plant a tree one afternoon. It’s small, but that’s meaningful travel to me.\r\n\r\n<strong>5 //</strong> Photograph the unseen. I travel for myself, to encourage others to do so, and to encourage them to think more open. Through my photography, I want to take more pictures of the locals, the unseen places in a city and goodness.\r\n\r\nMy idea of meaningful travel is still forming, but I love the idea of this being a next step in my traveling career. Through meaningful travel, I hope to enrich my travel experiences for not just me but others. <strong>How would you define meaningful travel? Please give examples in the comments, and I will share on social media.</strong>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',

I used to walk around with a small Canon snap-and-shoot, taking pictures with wonky angles and using camera filters. It was all fun and games, and my first abroad experience in Europe shared many of these themes. Now, I can say my photography has developed to a brand new level. <a href="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/photography/">[View my photography page HERE.]</a> It’s turning into a fun, exciting hobby that helps me capture beautiful moments on my travels and share them with others over the internet. Like you! Encouraging you. Empowering you to discover the world. Travel bloggers have shared post after post of favorite photography equipment, but each of us has a different perspective on this. This is because photography is an ART. It is subjective, with each of us creating something unique and beautiful.\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="size-full wp-image-1222 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a> <span style="color: #ffffff;">THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR TRAVEL BLOGGING</span>\r\n\r\nIn this post, I am going to layout for you my <b>bare essential</b> travel photography equipment. Now, I am not one of those National Geographic travel bloggers, lugging around bags of equipment ranging in the thousands. I keep my equipment simple, because it is even more important for me to enjoy the experiences when I am in the moment. Without being weighed down by excessive photography equipment. Here is my favorite photography equipment:\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-556" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-Oct-21-10-39-30-PM.jpg" alt="THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR TRAVEL BLOGGING" width="1200" height="900" />\r\n\r\n<strong>//  CAMERA &amp; EXCHANGEABLE LENSES</strong>\r\n\r\nI personally shoot with a <strong>Canon T5 Rebel DSLR camera</strong>. When I bought this snazzy camera, I was just getting into photography, and I wanted to take my photography to the next level. This camera is considered a ‘beginner’s’ camera, but I have found it to provide the photographs I want, while still being lightweight. It is my belief, the photographer and a good quality lens is what makes the photograph. So, I shoot with an entry-level Canon Rebel, but I buy quality lenses. Favorites in my collection are: <strong>Canon 50mm</strong> and <strong>Canon 10-18mm</strong>. I am currently thinking of adding another prime lens to my collection [i.e. a prime lens/fixed lens does not zoom, offers a sharper picture and color]. A Canon 25mm or 40mm is on my radar. I’m choosing large wide-angle lenses, because I shoot in places like Italy, with close up buildings. I want to make sure I can get that entire building [or almost all of it] with one lens. I use my 50mm to grab those amazing close up shots or portraits. All encompassing, I love prime/fixed lenses. They provide fantastic quality, sharp images and encourage me to sit on the ground, turn over backwards or run far away to grab the perfect shot. The camera also provides great video for vlogging. Another camera that I have in my kit, the <strong>GoPro Hero</strong>. It’s perfect for all those adventure shots - skiing down the Alps, snorkeling in the Maldives and more.\r\n<div class="table-1">\r\n<table width="100%">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th align="left"></th>\r\n<th align="left"></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="left"><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=hello0c5-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B00X8MRBCW&amp;asins=B00X8MRBCW&amp;linkId=5abfcdfb83bafce0ccf2926a0306db8a&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no">\r\n</iframe></td>\r\n<td align="left"><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=hello0c5-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B00K899B9Y&amp;asins=B00K899B9Y&amp;linkId=5de6ac42161e9a3a885d94fb38655b94&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no">\r\n</iframe></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-Oct-21-10-37-11-PM-1.jpg" alt="THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR TRAVEL BLOGGING" width="1200" height="900" />\r\n\r\n<strong>//  BAGS &amp; TRIPODS</strong>\r\n\r\nEvery travel blogger has to have a snazzy bag that will [somehow] find its way into most of your <a href="http://www.instagram.com/hellomeganmarie">Instagram pictures</a>. You have incredible options on Amazon, but I suggest a bag that holds your camera and one or two lenses. This will keep you from buying to many ‘add-ons’ and complaining later when your shoulder hurts from a long day of walking. [We have all done it.] The second [big] plus to place inside your bag is a quality tripod. Again, Amazon is your friend. The <strong><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large">Gorillapod </span>tripod</strong> is particularly my favorite, because it twists and turns multiple ways. I can set it on multiple surfaces, and it easily fits in my backpack.\r\n<div class="table-1">\r\n<table width="100%">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th align="left"><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=hello0c5-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B01CKSEC62&amp;asins=B01CKSEC62&amp;linkId=472a150cca943728e64e9d06fb0155dc&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no">\r\n</iframe></th>\r\n<th align="left"><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=hello0c5-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B00TCKRKU2&amp;asins=B00TCKRKU2&amp;linkId=fa294a785ed5fdf0c6137087f05dd798&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no">\r\n</iframe></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>// CLEANING EQUIPMENT</strong>\r\n\r\nEvery photographer has to have basic cleaning equipment. This keeps your equipment in tip-top shape during travels [when anything can happen to your precious camera]. Make sure to include a <strong>dust</strong> <strong>blower</strong> for removing dust from the camera/lens, a <strong>camera cloth</strong> and small <strong>brush</strong>. For the blower, make sure to turn your DSLR camera on ‘cleaning mode’ before using. This will pop up the mirror, so you can have a deeper cleaning. Always keep the blower in a plastic bag, so dust doesn’t get captured inside. A good camera cleaning cloth will cost you $5-$10 American dollars. Only use your cleaning cloth for your camera, and never for your glasses or computer. The oil from your body will eventually deteriorate the lens. Also, don’t blow on your lens. [!!] These are all beginner, amateur mistakes I made. [Ha, ha] Learn from me!\r\n<div class="table-1">\r\n<table width="100%">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th align="left"></th>\r\n<th align="left"></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="left"><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=hello0c5-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B001J5N80E&amp;asins=B001J5N80E&amp;linkId=c92ad2bb706ff8a68ce8fb456e6805c9&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no">\r\n</iframe></td>\r\n<td align="left"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>//  PHOTOGRAPHY EDITING</strong>\r\n\r\nAlways try your best to capture the perfect picture, before you take the photograph to the editing phase. Thinking in this way will encourage you to improve your photography as an art, and think of it as a developing skill. In the editing phase, I use <strong>ADOBE Lightroom App</strong>, <strong>LightZone</strong>, <strong>DropBox</strong> and Photoshop [sometimes]. Adobe Lightroom is extremely versatile and easy-to-use. The app is free, so I would start there. I use DropBox to store my images on the cloud, download them onto my iPad with the DropBox app and edit them using Lightroom. It works. LightZone is a free, user friendly application that is downloadable from the internet. It does many similar things as Lightroom, but it does not have as many filters. Download it. It’s free.\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-554" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-Oct-21-10-36-06-PM.jpg" alt="THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR TRAVEL BLOGGING" width="1200" height="900" />\r\n\r\nTravel photography can be an extremely expensive hobby, if you let it take off. You have countless options in multiple camera bags, additional lens, reflectors, flashes and remotes. Amazon is your friend! It has everything you need in equipment, and it is very reasonably priced. This post is intended to provide you with the very basics. Having more is always great, but remember you have to carry all of that. Everything that I mentioned in this post, I carry on all my travels abroad, so it is completely doable and lightweight. Okay, it is your turn. <strong>What do you consider a travel photographer’s ESSENTIALS that are absolutely needed?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>This post contains affiliate links, which means that I receive a small commission for providing a link to the product on my website.

For me, it’s one of the major sources of inspiration for my travel wanderlust. I scroll through hundreds of fantastic photos everyday from all over the world. New countries like Bali, Cambodia and Iceland call my name, begging me to embark on another adventure. We follow small, medium and large accounts, but usually it is the large accounts. These large accounts are the ones that are often referred to us. That is because [of their extreme following] they are able to reach more individuals through various hashtags, their own organic following and Instagram’s search menu. What about the little travel guys? The beautiful instagrammers that are still under 10,000 follows, but offer fantastic and inspiring travel content. Well, you are in luck. I am highlighting several of my favorite low key travel instagrammers in the post below. Follow them and enjoy their photographs as much as I do. <span style="color: #ffffff;">13 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS</span>\r\n<h1># 1 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gotthetravelbugtoo/">@gotthetravelbugtoo</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-522" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-9.00.35-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1062" height="544" />\r\n<h1># 2 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wonderfulwanderings/">@wonderfulwanderings</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.59.14-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1026" height="553" />\r\n<h1># 3 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nomadic.mark/">@nomadic.mark</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.56.52-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1056" height="535" />\r\n<h1 class="_i572c notranslate" title="jlanctot_travel_photography"># 4  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jlanctot_travel_photography/">@jlanctot_travel_photography</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.55.43-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1039" height="544" />\r\n\r\n<a href="http://theartisticbrunette.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=cd76f5afca"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-440" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Website-opt-in.jpg" alt="website-opt-in" width="1200" height="300" /></a>\r\n<h1># 5  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thehighroadtraveler/">@thehighroadtraveler</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.54.49-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1047" height="563" />\r\n<h1># 6  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adriftanywhere_travelblog/">@adriftanywhere_travelblog</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.53.23-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1031" height="552" />\r\n<h1># 7  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pia_pw/">@pia_pw</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-516" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.51.46-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1038" height="532" />\r\n<h1># 8  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/annelisestravels/">@annelisestravels</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-514" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.50.13-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1085" height="537" />\r\n<h1># 9  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladydestination/">@LadyDestination</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-510" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-8.48.20-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="1008" height="489" />\r\n<h1># 10  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hellomeganmarie/">@hellomeganmarie</a></h1>\r\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-523" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-9.23.01-AM.png" alt="9 INSPIRING TRAVEL INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS" width="999" height="558" />\r\n\r\nIs the wanderlust brewing?

When I venture out and then somehow find myself back at home, I am usually dreaming of the next destination within a couple days. My nomadic life and hopping from country to country has turned me into a women with restless feet. Because of this new lifestyle, I have learned to save money in every way possible. The more money I can save on trips equals more money I can allot to new trips. In my mind, it is a realistic solution. This is my ultimate travel flight hacks. <span style="color: #ffffff;">MY</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #ffffff;"> ULTIMATE TRAVEL FLIGHT HACKS<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1222" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/banner-access-e1534841673941.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="90" /></a></span>\r\n\r\nTransportation and accommodation are always the major expense in travel. It doesn’t matter how long and far I search, this always seems to be the ultimate conclusion. When searching for the best flight hack, you have to consider the time that it will take you. Great prices are rarely found on the first search. It is a constant research battle, looking for the best price to your destination. When looking for the best price, flexibility in your travel time is your best ally. It is usually cheaper to fly mid-week and sometimes on a Sunday. Summer and the Christmas season are always the most expensive. The best time to buy your tickets are 6-8 weeks before your departure, depending if you are domestic or international. It is a lot of work to find the best solution, but lucky you, I did most of the initial work for you. Download these apps and follow these websites for the best flight deals:\r\n<h2>Travel Flight Apps</h2>\r\n<em>Skyscanner</em>\r\n\r\nI have been using Skyscanner for the last year, and I am in love. It is an extremely versatile app, that provides multiple flight options. It also provides the ability to save searches or individual flights, and the app will ‘ping’ you when the price has dropped. I am currently looking at a flight to Berlin from Miami, hovering around $225.\r\n\r\n<em>Kayak</em>\r\n\r\nI have been using Kayak for even longer than Skyscanner. Again this app provides the ability to look through all airlines, not just the major pricey airlines. It will also mix and max between budget and regular to give you the best price possible.\r\n\r\n<em>Airfare Watchdog</em>\r\n\r\nI am fairly new to this one, but I have heard a few decent reviews. When searching for the best flight price, you should never be searching just on one app or website. You need to be searching on several, comparing prices and grabbing that deal when you see it.\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember with the apps listed above, regular search engines like Orbitz and Travelocity are not pulling all budget airlines into their algorithms. For this reason, I prefer the above flight apps over the traditional ones.\r\n<h2>Travel Flight Websites</h2>\r\n<em>The Flight Deal Daily Deals Newsletter</em>\r\n\r\nI’ve been following this newsletter for about a half a year, and I cry every time the prices come through. This newsletter is mostly FLASH SALES given by major airlines. We are talking $166 round trip from Orlando, Florida to LAX in California. Now that’s a deal!\r\n\r\n<em>STA Travel</em>\r\n\r\nI used this website fairly often when I booked my first solo flights. I’ve been able to find decent deals hovering around $600 round trip from LAX to Germany. The deals are there, but you have to watch the price. I have not found the ability to save searches and for the website to ‘ping’ you when prices drop. That is a negative, but the website offers other great advantages for young travelers. You can find great deals on travel insurance and arranged trips.\r\n\r\n<em>Budget Airlines</em>\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is better to go straight to the source. Budget airlines are popping up all over the world, and particularly from the United States to Europe. I flew from Berlin to Miami on EuroWings for $250 one-way. WOW air has cheap flights to Iceland and Europe. Norwegian Air is great from Miami to Europe. In the United States, Spirit Airlines and Southwest seem to be the best, unless one of the major airlines are having a flash scale. (Sign up for that Flight Deal Daily Deals newsletter!)\r\n\r\nUltimately, my point in writing this post to let you know of options. I used to spend $1,000s of American dollars to fly to Europe. That is not the case anymore, and you should not be spending that. Use these tips and become a smarter traveler. I am excited to hear the destinations you explore!\r\n\r\n<em><strong>What are your flight travel hacks?</strong></em> Share them in the comments, and I will re post them on my social media (linked to your profile).\r\n\r\n<a href="https://hellomeganmarie.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4161acaece8d01ee6020d09ef&amp;id=3cddbe8719"><img class="size-full wp-image-1219 aligncenter" src="http://www.mtcthecontentagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/email-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" /></a>\r\n\r\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]',
